Today I am in County Cork, Cork City to be exact.

I am running around like a mad man trying to find gifts for people but I am pretty sure that I am finished with everything!!!!

Also, Ireland is still amazing!

Otherwise, be on the lookout for pics and I will try to be available on Saturday June 28.

Peace out for now
