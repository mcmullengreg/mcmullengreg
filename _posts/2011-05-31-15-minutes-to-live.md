In an effort to improve my writing skills and to post more frequently I have decided to join the #Trust30 effort. Luckily I won&#8217;t have to be too creative as there will be prompts for me to write about. Today&#8217;s prompt by [Gwen Bell](https://twitter.com/gwenbell) is &#8220;15 Minutes to Live&#8221;

> &#8220;We are afraid of truth, afraid of fortune, afraid of death, and afraid of each other. Our age yields no great and perfect persons. â€“ Ralph Waldo Emerson&#8221;

These are the last notes that I would write to my friends and family:

**Mom and Dad:**
  
Unfortunately I&#8217;ve been told that I&#8217;ve only been given 15 more minutes to live. I just want you to know that I have appreciated absolutely everything you&#8217;ve ever done for me. You supported all of my dreams and ambitions and even pushed me toward goals that I never thought I&#8217;d be able to reach. I just want you to know that I&#8217;m sorry that I wasn&#8217;t around nearly enough to help you.

I know I don&#8217;t say it nearly enough, but I love you both and wish I could have spent this time with you.

**To Lloyd, Kyle, & Mike:**
  
You three have been the best friends that anyone can ask for. Kyle, I&#8217;m sorry that I wasn&#8217;t able to see you in Florida but I&#8217;m glad that my last weekend here was during your wedding. Lloyd, take care of the kids and make sure that your wife doesn&#8217;t corrupt them by having them support the Bengals. Mike, keep up with the hard work and earn that Ph. D. You&#8217;re the best man for it, I know your dad would be proud.

**To my Brother: Here&#8217;s the speech that you deserve.**
  
Kelly, you&#8217;ve found a great guy. He may be somewhat standoffish and hardheaded but he truly does have a good heart. The two of you were lucky to find each other. Just don&#8217;t forget to support each other&#8217;s needs, wants and desires. You never know how much you&#8217;ll need one another until you don&#8217;t have that support net. Welcome to the family, Kelly.

_**BTW:** This is not the same speech I WILL be giving_

**To the love of my life:**
  
Sarah, you&#8217;ve meant the world to me. Even though we&#8217;ve had our fights and arguments you&#8217;ve truly been the best. I&#8217;m so happy that I was able to have you in my life making me a better person. The only thing that I ask is that you stay in contact with all the friends that we&#8217;ve made over the years and become the doctor that you&#8217;ve wanted to be for so long. Try not to be so hard on yourself. You may think that you&#8217;ve failed every test, but I know better.

Just remember the times that we had, and thank you for always being my source of strength and support.

**To everyone else:** Live your life to the fullest. No regrets and remember to never let life take control of you, you are the one in control.

Love always,
  
Greg
