**Update:** I&#8217;ve revisited this code to clean it up and make it much more useable. [View the updated code]({% post_url 2013-05-29-updated-structured-umbraco-page-titles %}).

If you are looking for some code to generate tiered page titles within Umbraco here is an example that worked for our site. This code assumes you are using pageTitle as a DocType element.
