Today&#8217;s task seems slightly more daunting than yesterday. Somehow I am supposed to describe my day in only one sentence. Shouldn&#8217;t be too hard&#8230;right? [Author [Liz Danzico](http://dis.bobulate.com/about/).

> &#8220;Your genuine action will explain itself, and will explain your other genuine actions. Your conformity explains nothing. The force of character is cumulative. â€“ Ralph Waldo Emerson, Self-Reliance&#8221;

**My Response:** Don&#8217;t let today get in the way of the rest of your life; you&#8217;ll have struggles but keep your friends and family close, they&#8217;re the best support you&#8217;ll ever need.

Some people reading this may not like [Eminem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminem) or his music, however, the song [Lose Yourself](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lose_Yourself) from [8 Mile](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298203/) is extremely powerful to me. That&#8217;s the reason why I have decided to post that video alongside this post.
