> To believe your own thought, to believe that what is true for you in your private heart is true for all men, that is genius. â€“ Ralph Waldo Emerson

What is burning deep inside of you? If you could spread your personal message RIGHT NOW to 1 million people, what would you say?

If I had the chance to share my personal message with anyone, it would always be the same. 

_&#8220;Always do your best and never let anyone say you aren&#8217;t good enough. Work through the tough times because the end result is always better than you could ever imagine. Finally, only worry about things that you can control, life is too short to through a fit over things that you have no control over._

That&#8217;s it, short and sweet! What would you say? How would you share your message?
