I honestly can&#8217;t remember the last time I actually wanted to make a New Year&#8217;s resolution. However, I am wanting to better my life and others around me so here it is; making it 100% public for the first time.

**First:** Eat out less and stop buying microwaveable/prepackaged frozen foods.
  
**Second:** Work out more. (The typical New Year&#8217;s Resolution, right?)
  
**Third:** Take care of myself and things I care about first and make more time for these things.
  
**Fourth:** Take more pictures! It&#8217;s something I enjoy, and I need to take advantage of it.

I know it&#8217;s well after the new year, but I still want these&nbsp;publicly known so that friends and family can hold me accountable.
