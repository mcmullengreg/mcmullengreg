The other day, I finally decided to weigh myself. I weighed in at 194.4lbs. New goal, weigh in the 180&#8217;s before August 11.

The immediate question on my mind is not, &#8220;why don&#8217;t I take better care of myself.&#8221; Rather it&#8217;s &#8220;why is it coaches seem to take better care of their athletes than themselves.&#8221; Maybe I&#8217;m wrong, but I would love for others to chime in.

So I want to reach out to all gathering ideas on the subject and how we can change our actions to better portray the things we teach.

**Edit:** The &#8220;ideal body weight&#8221; for my height (6&#8217;0&#8243;) is 140 &#8211; 184lbs.
