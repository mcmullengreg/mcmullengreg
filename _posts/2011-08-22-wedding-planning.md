As some of you may (or not) know Sarah and I are engaged. We have been for just over a week and we have been obviously talking about our wedding. Within the last week (or so) we&#8217;ve accomplished just a few different things.

  * Found the photographer
  * Found our Church and Pastor
  * Have the venue picked out for the reception (not the food yet)
  * Put our [wedding bands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_ring) in lay away (Thanks Shane Co.)
  * Found the possible dress and tux/suit colors
  * Found a place for invitations
  * Have friends helping us find flowers and a [cake decorator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake_decorating)
  * Setup a special surprise for our guests (you&#8217;ll just have to wait!)

Now, to some of you it may be a surprise that we&#8217;ve done all of this. However, what&#8217;s missing? Oh yea, could it possibly be the date of our wedding?

For whatever reason, it seems as though Sarah&#8217;s Medical School Program doesn&#8217;t want to work with us. While we have the ideal situation picked out, it&#8217;s hard to book anything without having a date.

Let&#8217;s just hope we get one soon.

**Edit:** As of 8/22/2011 at about 4pm this post isn&#8217;t nearly as relevant. Our date is now set!
