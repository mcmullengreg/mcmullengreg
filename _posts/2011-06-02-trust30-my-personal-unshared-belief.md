> It is easy in the world to live after the world’s opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude. &#8211; Ralph Waldo Emerson, Self-Reliance

The world is powered by passionate people, powerful ideas, and fearless action. What’s one strong belief you possess that isn’t shared by your closest friends or family? What inspires this belief, and what have you done to actively live it?

I&#8217;ve read a few different posts regarding today&#8217;s [#trust30](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23trust30) prompt, 2 of them were regarding religion. While I do feel like my thoughts on religion are different from most of my friends and family that&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m going to focus on here. 

While visiting Ireland back in 2008 I was talking to a few individuals in a pub and a gentleman said, &#8220;All Americans are the same, you only live to work! We work so that we can live&#8230;&#8221; He was entirely right, Americans have been classically trained to do nothing but work. After taking my job I realized that everyone there has that mentality that work comes first, and I knew for sure that I didn&#8217;t want to be sucked into that mindset.

Now, I know that I&#8217;ve been given something completely new to my workplace, short hours. So yes, I do get off work at 2:00 and get to enjoy a majority of the afternoon. However, this is where the difference lies. When I&#8217;m off work, I&#8217;m out of the office and off work. Meaning, I rarely respond my e-mail, although I will check it for emergencies using my Blackberry, and I take the time to do things that I enjoy. Around my workplace most people come into work at 6 and don&#8217;t leave until about 6 or 7 that evening.

Live your life to the fullest. Yes, you will have to work, but there is not a single reason why it should interfere with your dreams and passions. I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to have the short schedule so when I&#8217;m not coaching I can come home and relax, go to the gym or even coach swimming (a true passion). Don&#8217;t let work overtake your life.

Why don&#8217;t you join in on the fun in the comments? What&#8217;s something you believe that your friends or family don&#8217;t? Also take a look at a related post by [Randy Clark](http://twitter.com/randyclarktko) titled [Are You Happy?]({% post_url 2010-09-27-are-you-happy %}).
