Over the weekend, a friend asked me to do something I&#8217;ve never done before. Photograph their wedding.

While I wasn&#8217;t the official photographer, I was askedÂ to take one of the last photos of the night. The one posted below. I have never done photos like this and was impressed with my results. I have done zero post work (yet) and am looking for tips/tricks/advice on post work and general thoughts of how it turned out.

<div id="attachment_11101" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <img class="size-full wp-image-11101" alt="Photo from M&J's wedding." src="http://wp.gregoryamcmullen.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/20120918-233106-e1355330340139.jpg" width="450" height="677" />
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">

**Edit:** I recently visited the home of this couple and was pleasantly surprised to see my photography hanging in their living room. I am so proud to be apart of this couples day and happy to have this hanging in their home.
