With my first collegiate season under my belt, I am definitely looking forward to my second year (and more, if possible).

We wrapped up the season with 20 individual records (more with diving) and had two compete at the NCAA Division III National Championships.

## Challenges

Being a first-year (first-time collegiate) coach was intimidating. While I felt the need to approach the athletes different, I didn&#8217;t. They were responsive to my critiques and criticisms, inviting the views from a coach they didn&#8217;t know that well.

As the year progressed, I got worn down and contemplated quitting. Sarah kept me focused by reminding me of the previous two years and how excited I was to see the hard work pay off.

## Results

  * Two National Qualifiers
  * 20 School Records
  * 13 Provisional Qualification times
  * 14 All-Conference Awards
  * Five event victories

Outside of the pool, our teams earned an All-Academic selection.

## Goals for Next Year

I need to continue to push my boundaries and get more involved in finding out &#8220;what works&#8221; and &#8220;why.&#8221; This can only help me grow as a coach and an ambassador for our sport.
