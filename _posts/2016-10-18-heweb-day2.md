   - Allows management of WordPress data from external sources

**Why use the ReST API?**

- You request what you want; and it comes in it's own bucket
- Don't have to build the HTML you are receiving it from; but on the end it's being consumed.

**Hurdles**

- Very little included in core, need a few additional plugins
- Meta data is protected; need to authenticate to get it
- Authenticating is challenging
- Custom endpoints for custom content
