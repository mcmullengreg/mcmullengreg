> Success is Peace of Mind which is a direct result of self satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do the best of which you are capable.
  - John Wooden

If you were one of the many Americans watching the Women&#8217;s National team make a run toward the <a title="FIFA Women's World Cup" href="http://www.fifa.com/womensworldcup/index.html">FIFA Women&#8217;s World Cup</a> Final were you disappointed?

By looking at the team accomplishments, you&#8217;ll proud!

## Team USA Accomplishments

  * Hope Solo went 1,054 minutes without allowing a goal.
  * Team USA only lost 3 matches in 2011 &#8211; Four Nations Tournament, International Friendly and to Sweden in the Women&#8217;s World Cup.
  * Made it to the World Cup Final defeating Brazil. Undoubtedly a top contender.

So in all honesty, why be disappointed about? The women&#8217;s soccer program was rejuvenated by the 2011 World Cup because of their performance.

I know people don&#8217;t like to lose, but sometimes you have to look at the entire result of a game, meet or match. Did you do more than you ever thought you could? Did you improve upon previous attempts? Did your team come together in a time of struggle?

These things are more important than winning. While it can help boost a team&#8217;s morale by winning the big game, it&#8217;s your job as a parent, coach or friend to make the team realize that they did a hell of a job even without the &#8220;W&#8221;.

So how do you manage to overcome disappointment? Are you irritated when you lose or are you happy to get a chance? Share your thoughts.
