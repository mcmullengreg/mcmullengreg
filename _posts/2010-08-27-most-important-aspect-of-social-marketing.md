**What&#8217;s so important about Social Media?**

Whether you are just starting out or are a social media ninja there’s one thing that’s always going to be important in the art of Social Media Marketing. YOU!

Without You, there aren’t going to be any interactions. Posting “Here’s our deal, buy from us” isn’t engaging your customers. YOU need to start having a conversation with someone, YOU need to reply to messages that interest you and YOU need to share what will interest your friends or followers.

The idea of Microblogging has been redeveloped. When Twitter was released I thought it was just like blogging (which I was wrong, I have to admit it) “Tell me what you’re doing; Where you went; How you did \___”. Boy was I mistaken.

Social media revolves around conversations, whether that’s creating new ones or simply watching for something to reply to all you need to be is yourself.
