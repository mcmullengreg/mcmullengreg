I&#8217;m sure that you&#8217;ve heard the old phrase &#8220;Don&#8217;t Judge a book by it&#8217;s cover&#8221; but is that really how we operate? I know that I am guilty of judging someone based on their looks.

When we are looking for something or someone we look at links, videos, and images. What I want to talk about is your personal appearance, particularly in your online avatar. If you were to show up to an interview in a pair of ripped jeans, a dirty polo and basketball shoes would you be received the same as if you were to show up wearing a professionally cleaned and tailored suit? I think not!

The same goes for your online appearance. You **cannot** expect to be taken serious as an 18-year old at a party with a beer in your hand. Marketing yourself starts with your initial appearance. This doesn&#8217;t mean that you have to go out and have a professional head shot done (however [@mooshinindy](http://www.twitter.com/mooshinindy) or [@joshhumble](http://www.twitter.com/joshhumble) could help you there). You just need to make sure that you are portraying yourself in a manner that is not detrimental to those judging you solely based on your cover.

As was stated by Casey Mullins (@mooshinindy) at the @BlogIndiana Conference &#8220;Find three words that describe you and have your avatar represent those three things.&#8221; 

One last thing to remember, you can never get a second first impression.
