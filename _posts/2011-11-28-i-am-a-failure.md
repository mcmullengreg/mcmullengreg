There are two Michael Jordan quotes that truly are amazing. Actually, he has quite a few quotes on this topic; the two I am going to focus on are some of my favorites.

> I&#8217;ve missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I&#8217;ve lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I&#8217;ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I&#8217;ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed. - Michael Jordan

## Failure leads to Success

I recently wrote [Taking Risks; Meeting Opportunities](http://gregoryamcmullen.com/personal/taking-risks-meeting-opportunity "Taking Risks; Meeting Opportunity") because of my own life experiences. I&#8217;ve been too afraid at times to move on; mainly because I&#8217;m afraid of failure myself. However, should you be afraid to fail? Or simply learn from those around you and the mistakes that you&#8217;ve made in your life.

The best example I can currently think of involves Steve Jobs. We all know of the risks he took in the computer and entertainment industries, but amidst his success there was also failure.

> Jobs failed better than anyone else in Silicon Valley, maybe better than anyone in corporate America. By that I mean Jobs did what only the greatest entrepreneurs can do: learn from their failures. I donâ€™t mean learn from their mistakes. I mean learn from their abject, humiliating, bonehead, epic fails. [Celebrating Steve Jobs&#8217; Failures](http://blog.heritage.org/2011/08/26/celebrating-steve-jobs-failures/)

The moral of this post is to accept failure. Own up to your failures and most importantly __never stop learning__. As soon as you give up on learning; you are abandoning success too.

And just because I can, I&#8217;ll leave you with one more MJ quote:

> I can accept failure, everyone fails at something. But I can&#8217;t accept not trying.
