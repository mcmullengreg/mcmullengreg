This image was captured while on vacation at Ft Myers Beach. Sarah and I were walking along the beach to this pier on our second to last morning and I decided to capture this as a Hand-Held [HDR photo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range_imaging). All things considered, I really like the way it turned out. Not sure how I was able to capture the waves, but I&#8217;m glad that I did.
