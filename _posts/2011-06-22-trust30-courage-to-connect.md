> Men imagine that they communicate their virtue or vice only by overt actions, and do not see that virtue or vice emit a breath every moment. &#8211; Ralph Waldo Emerson

Who is one person that you’ve been dying to connect with, but just haven’t had the courage to reach out to? First, reflect on why you want to get in touch with them. Then, reach out and set up a meeting.

* * *

Recently, I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of research on swimming, which may come as no surprise to any of you out there. One of the sites that I like to frequent is by Former Olympic Swimmer Glenn Mills, [GoSwim.tv](http://goswim.tv)

## Why do I want to reach out?

While I feel like the connections I&#8217;m making in Indianapolis and the surrounding areas are valuable, it&#8217;s always nice to have an experienced mentor. Someone you can ask questions, get advice from and look up to. The head coach at Pike is a great resource and I know that he&#8217;s dedicated to the sport (ASCA Level 3 Coach), but isn&#8217;t it nice to have more than one person to discuss (tips, techniques, ideas, etc) with? 

Coach Mills has been involved in swimming for over 30 years and has truly been tested, strained and has proven his techniques work by being certified as an ASCA Level 5 Coach. View [Glenn Mills&#8217; bio](http://www.goswim.tv/entries/768/glenn-mills.html) on GoSwim.tv.

To give you a better idea what the coaching levels mean here&#8217;s an excerpt from the [<em>ASCA Coaches Certification the Purpose and the Process</em>](http://www.swimmingcoach.org/pdf/certapp.pdf). (PDF)

> There are three things analyzed in the Certification process. They are: Education, Experience and Achievement. Your Certification shows that you have met the required standard at each Level. The Five Levels become increasingly difficult. Level 5 is composed of the top 2-5% of coaches in the USA. Level 4 is the top 5-8% and Level 3 is the upper 15% of coaches. Level 2 requires more “units” of education and experience than Level 1.

## How will I reach out?

Well, I honestly already have. I follow Coach Mills on Twitter (@GoSwim), read and watch his coaching ideas or technique tips and (attempt) to comment on things that interest and intrigue me.

My plan is to continue on this approach, ask questions and get insight on how to become a better coach and leader.

Who is someone you are afraid to reach out and connect with? Why are you afraid? How can you overcome that fear? Share your thoughts and this post, it&#8217;s always appreciated.
