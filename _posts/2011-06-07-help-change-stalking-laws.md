How You Can Help

On June 23, Jodi’s Voice will be having an event in Las Vegas called Fight Stalking in partnership with Sky Combat Ace. Celebrities from the world of entertainment will be going up against each other in aerial combat. Supporters of each celebrity can back their champions with donations and messages of support, and the funds raised will go to Jodi’s Voice.

And it’s the June event for Danny Brown’s 12for12K, an organization that aims to raise a minimum of $12,000 for a different charity each month.

## You can help by:

  * If you or someone you know has been the victim of stalking and you wish to share your story, share in the comments or on our Facebook page.
  * Add a 12for12k Twibbon to your Twitter or Facebook profile picture. Details can be found here along with instructions on how to change your picture.
  * Write a blog post of your own, and either share your story or link back to this post.
  * Make a donation to Jodi’s Voice, a full 501(c)3 registered charity (12for12K is talking with a few organizations to make a matching grant). You can use the ChipIn widget below, and it will go direct to Jodi’s Voice and you will receive a tax receipt (payments can be made via Paypal or credit card) – just click on the green ChipIn button. You can also embed the widget on your own blog by using the Copy option.
