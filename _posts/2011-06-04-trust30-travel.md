> If we live truly, we shall see truly. &#8211; Ralph Waldo Emerson

Not everyone wants to travel the world, but most people can identify at least one place in the world theyâ€™d like to visit before they die. Where is that place for you, and what will you do to make sure you get there?

## I&#8217;ve been lucky&#8230;

While I was still in school I was able to travel to the one place outside of the US that I&#8217;ve always wanted to visit, [the Republic of Ireland](http://www.discoverireland.com/int/). I was able to travel here thanks to a study abroad program over the summer in 2008.

The reason that I&#8217;ve wanted to go to Ireland was because my family has told me that our ancestors are from there. The trip lasted for two weeks and was absolutely amazing.

## My travel plans aren&#8217;t for me&#8230;

That&#8217;s right, now I know that this challenge is supposed to allow you to look closer into your own life so you can trust yourself. However, my goal for traveling is setting up a trip for my entire family to go to Ireland. My family&#8217;s last vacation was in 1995, which wasn&#8217;t even a full family vacation.

My parent&#8217;s (dad more so) have always expressed how much they&#8217;ve wanted to travel to Ireland so they could see where our McMullen family comes from. It&#8217;s an amazing trip and I would highly recommend it for anyone.

## Additional Travel Plans&#8230;

I wouldn&#8217;t say that I&#8217;m entirely apt to travel, however, I would enjoy seeing some of the following places before I take the plunge into the dirt:

  * The Grand Canyon (saw it in 2016 on my way to Vegas, I think)
  * Redwood Forest
  * Rome
  * Greece

Where would you like to travel? How are you going to make sure that you get there? Share your thoughts in the comments!
