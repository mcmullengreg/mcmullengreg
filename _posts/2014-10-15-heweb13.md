## Build a calendar that doesn't suck - LiveWhale Calendar

**Why calendars are what they are:**

- Most calendars on the web are byproducts of EMS, Room reservation systems and resource scheduling systems.
- For some, these are products are an afterthought
- Room reservation is like meth (if you never have it, it's fine; 
- People think of events as a marketing item
- Every audience depends on events, but everyone's needs are different

**Ideas and Suggestions:**

- Tell everyone who will listen that events are crucially important part of marketing
    - Three most overlooked opportunities
    - What do students do on the weekends
    - Is it boring to live in ___ (Terre Haute)
    - What is my alma mater doing with my money
    - These are questions that people ACTUALLY ask
- Don't go anywhere near a calendar solution that doesn't export data in open formats like RSS
- A perfect calendar has to be all things to everyone, it can't be done
- Calendar will disappoint someone; even if it doesn't suck

- Some will love it; something that addresses their needs!

Go out and "Not suck"

## THE SCROLL #getscrolled - hamilton.edu/thescroll - Hamilton College

All the different online media/social accounts/email etc. At the institutional level. SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS

Not a lot of give and take with the audience

Use *found* content - It's on social media, but not on our site…how do we get it there?

**What's the problem?**

- Who's the audience? - specific things at specific times/ you DO have a specific audience
- Trying to communicate?
- Success looks like?
- Current Preferences? How do they WANT to engage with us
- Infuence mentions and engagement - Brand inconsistencies; Not artsy etc. etc.
- Flip the way people see you by using Social Media
- FB/TW/Instagram - were the most used
- FB is pages/groups/events (brand, authentic in what's shared with us)

**TEACH strategy**

- This is how we communicate from here on out - everyone goes into one pot
- Support their projects - It's "our" project, it's EVERYONE's responsibility to keep up with it
- Top down/Bottom Up
- Time Commitments 
  - Who has control? Depends on the place
  - Technical issues

**BRANDING focus - campaign is not marketing…it's capital campaigns in Higher Ed**

- No one voice outshining
- Watch the 'one offs'
- Everything supports larger brand ira
- Brand business and outcome
- The scroll pulls mentions - hash tags and a variety of other accounts
- No gimmicks
- Low barrier to entry
- The good and the Bad - Not too much of a problem anymore because it's REAL 
- Timeliness is crucial
- They do NOT autopost or schedule - Why not at all? Doing it responsibly?

**Every event has a Hashtag - it goes on EVERYTHING print email everything**

- 1 year ahead of time
- Coordinating conversations with various hashtags - They are useful everywhere now

**Social media directory - We need to build this...NOW**

- The Scroll
- My Hamilton

**ASK for audience ideas**

- Continue education
- Policy vs Guidelines - If you do it, here's how you are expected to behave
  - Before you are our community member, this is how you do it
  - Use social and Here's how - not Come to us to do social

Comment and content guidelines - Basic premise, if you don't say it to your mom; don't say it

**Measurement: Defining Goals**

- NOPE Vanity metrics (likes/followers)
- Positive Sentiment
- "The scroll" itself is probably the 10th most trafficked page.

EVERYTHING is hand-picked; nothing is added via aggregator

## #GIT -  

DIY Revision Control

- Duplicate each day
- Auto Revision from MS Word etc
- Pull recovery file

Revision Control Systems

- Track changes
- Better for source code

Why Choose Git?

- Open Source and free
- Distributed gives you autonomy
- Easy branching for experimenting
- The Delta It's Efficient
- Revisions, not versions
- Repo stores all changes
    - 1st change: git init
- Each change links to previous
- The 3 Areas
- Working Copy
    - Anytime I change or add to a repo 
    - Select things from the working copy and go to staging; then submit to the repo
- Staging Index
- Repo

Analogy - Packing a suitcase

- Take shirts out of closet, lay on bed - working copy
- Pick shirts from - From working put in pile ready to fold - staging area
- Fold it then "commit" to the suitcase - repo

- Choose pants from closet
- Choose from Pile and Fold
- Folded pants go into suitcase - repo & commit

Commands

- Take socks out of the drawer
- Command: none
    - Last time I looked, there were no socks; they were in the drawer
- Get socks; roll them up
    - Command: git add
        - Moves changes to stage from working copy
    - Command git commit
        - Records the changes to repo
        - Can commit one or multiple changes
- Step 4: Put unused clothes away
- Command: git checkout
    - Erases changes from the working copy
    - A good way to get out of a bad situation

Commit 1: Shirts

Commit 2: Shirts Pants

Commit 3: Shirts Pants Socks

Commits are sequential

"The Head" - Detached Head

- Points at the most recent commit for the branch you are on
- The head will pick up where you left off (like a cassette or video tape)

Branches

- Use Git within what you are already doing
    - Command: git branch <name>
- Clones your repo up until the most recent
- OR you can rewind it and clone from previous state
- New working copy and staging index
    - clean working copy
- Git Flow - a branching model
- Switching Branches
    - git checkout <name>
    - Quickly swap to different branch
    - Changes what's in your editor
    - Changes what's in the browser
- An Example: Trip to Jamaica
- git checkout <commit2>
- Set the HEAD to commit #2 (back to shirts and pants)
- Branch the rewind
    - git checkout - b <branchName>
- Get a passport
    - New item, not yet tracked
- Command: git add, put it right in the staging index
- Pack passport with git commit
- Merging changes
    - git merge
    - Take changes and merge them into the Master Branch
    - ALL items can come into both branches; or be selective
- Passive voices
    - 60-70 characters long
    - Learn Git Flow if working with other users
    
- Learn more: [http://try.github.io](http://try.github.io)
- Git Essential Training on Lynda.com
- http://git-scm.com/book

Forking - when you clone a remote repo and do your OWN changes to it.

## Digital Asset Management

Who should be included using the system?

How do you know what assets you have and what you go in

Practical Tips for IA with RWD:

- Kill the page…
- IA / Discovery phase
- Planning for function design and content while disregarding ALL assumptions about the device
- Content Modeling
    - Content types separate from design - NOTHING to do with design
    - What it is, what it says, and what attributes are assigned
    - Prepared for future friendly world
    - Device and platform agnostic
        - Consider size range of screens
        - Smart Watches/Car/Big screen/Smart TV/Small screens/Digital Signage
    - The accordion factor
        - Meaningful messages that can be used in our world
        - computers integrate more with humans
    - 77% of MOBILE searches take place at home or work, 17% on the-go according to Google.
    - Low-income/HS educated are more likely to be mobile-only
- How do we plan?
    - Kill the Page.
    - Blobs - Free for all WYSIWYG
        - Hand-me-down from print era; Insert (page) content here
        - No context when removed from form
        - "But I pasted a table from Word"
        - A blob is limiting and won't survive without a page!
    - Chunk - content removed, it still makes sense
        - Structured content with meta-data to give context
        - Removed from form, and still make sense (chunk and falfor, never ending story!)
        - Future friendly content = the never ending story
        - HOW do we create it?
            - structured content
            - semantic metadata
            - content packages
            - new user experience for content editors
        - Chunk content plan
            - Content matrix that separates out each piece of content type = content modeling
            - includes recommendations, attributes and suggestions
            - removes all notion of (page) location
            - Client uses as a worksheet to gather content regardless of where it goes
            - Enables us to implement the COPE method (create once publish everywhere)
                - Client never 
        - Excel Breakdown
            - General Content Needs - Questions that needs to get answered
                - What is ____
                - History of ____
                - About the space 
                - Who can use it
                - How can a new person get involved
                - Why should someone get involved (prospective)
            - Deliverables: client returns content entered into worksheet - separated from form
                - Focus is shifted to content alone!
            - This results in a path for structured content
- The How

Phases:

- Discovery
    - IA Questionnaire (who, what, when, why, wtf is the point!)
    - Analytics and peer site review
    - Deliverables: 10 Content priorities, "our" perspective - easier to edit than work together...
        - what is the most important piece to communicate?
- Sitemap/Annotated Sitemap
    - With a non device specific approach. Streamlined navigation. No 3rd level navigation if we can help it
    - Client deliverables:
        - PDF of proposed navigation structure
    - Internal Deliverable:
        - Annotated sitemap: excel document that lists my vision for what should go on each page. Column for functional requirements and for graphic needs. Keeping mobile in mind.
- Chunk content plan
    - Follow the chunk life cycle for { Project Team Title } and { Fun Fact } in the following
    - Semantic Metadata - entity relationship diagram for project teams
- Wireframe/IA
    - Mobile first - sit with iPhone in hand "how do I want to do this"
    - Project Team page first
    - Using UX Pin
- Design
    - Styling Chunks
    - Design the nag
- Dev - gives chunk content plan life!
    - Dev team took chunk plan and created a new type of field
    - Content packaages…tagging things..
    - Modules/Macros for inserting youtube links. Setup the MAX width/height to be specific
    - Should all chunks be viewable on mobile: ABSOLUTELY
- Training/Content Entry
- Launch

## The Nittany Leopard - Usability Testing and the Penn State Redesign

Using Drupal (7)

February 2013 - First site redesign in 10+ years

Groups were formed (volunteers) and different teams

- Research & more…

The people part: Developing usable co-workers, committees, bosses, stakeholders

- We have to talk - are they ready to hear bad or not awesome news?
- Don't oversell - small quick tests can be a hard sell in academics
- Data and video are hard to ignore
- 2-ish years of planning

Look at the things that DON't work - even stuff that you've built.

small groups aren't effective; but 8 would be effective (quick iterative testing) 

- Best we can know at this point in time

ARGUE LESS. TEST MORE.

- we can argue over what a link is, but let's test it and have data tomorrow to move forward
- Instead of us talking; let's do a test and get information
- Know what you can know when you can know it
    - Know everything you can BEFORE the site goes live. Test WHILE you IA, design, wireframe etc
- Redesign Objectives
    - Get applicants
    - Outward focused
    - Help raise awareness of Penn State as a public research university that serves pennsylvania and the world
    - Increase efficiency
    - Communicate PSU's identity to a global community through visual design and content that reinforces mission
    - Results should reflect the overall branding initiatives of academics research and global
    - drive….
- Benchmarking
- Big Ten Institutions
- Universities with a campus system
- Aspirational peers
- Non-higher ed institutions with complex structures
- Visual appeal/brand strength
- Steve Krug (don't make me think) layout/navigation
    - Create a clear visual hierarchy on each page
    - advantage of conventions
    - break up pages into clearly defined areas
    - make it obvious what's clickable
    - minimize noise
- Ranking things (1-7) of priorities and appeal
- Inventory the site and what the High Ed website looks like
- Convention not conformity
- Devil is in the details - many ways to implement, some are more effective
- Content strategy: What do we want the user to DO not just click or read
- Social Media can be more than a button - YES!

Best results come from testing no more than 5 users to get results

"Need a degree to figure out how to navigate the website" - actual user

Ask qualitative questions

- What's your impression of the site based on this page? watch users complete specific tasks
- Useful to confirm suspicions
- Small sample: 5-8 users at a time

Old site, first impressions:

- What's your initial impression
    - Not professional…amateur
    - Not much on the page; not very prestigious. Two fonts, two colors that's it. Not big at all. Rolling pictures of students being happy. Seems like there isn't much here
    - Unexpected results:
        - Some kind of cat on the left…
        - I remember the color blue and the cat…
        - Cat thing…
        - Nitany lion WOULD have been in the new design without these comments
- Design Elements, Very Blue:
    - They knew it was too blue, but didn't realize how MUCH so…
- Lists and Words and Words….
    - Simple website, separation of things, you have to read; no intuitive way of seeing what's what.  No pictures. All words.
    - Too many options within a list. Programs and admissions should be highlighted.
    - Links are NOW prioritized 5 links we want people to see; plus 20 others in different areas of priory
- Card Sorting! Usabila test - does the math connected to your cards
- Usabila - 50-90 a month; Click tracking https://usabilla.com 
- Flat image, ask a question and people click on 
    - Where would you click for (financial aid/ admissions/donations/etc)
    - Flat Images before anything else is developed
    - Where would you request information
    - Make sure this label = this thing
    - Can people easily find this men/button/item on the page
    - Did we get the labels right?
    - Do they understand how to find things

Wireframe and Design Testing:

- Takeaways
    - Placement and labels for research global this is pen state academics were working
    - User knew to click on academics to find degree programs
    - Apply now buttons
    - Super footer - 25% of users navigated to it
- Where would you click on this design if you were considering attending Penn State
    - Prospect
    - Admissions etc..
- Loop 11 - $350 / test
- Give it tasks and tell it the correct answer…
- Where they go, how they got to answer, how quickly and if they thought they got there
- One test old; one test new
- OLD SITE:
    - Find a list of Masters degree programs available through Penn state (40% success)
    - 53.8% Graduate School - paths: 15% to PSI.edu; 13% Fail/abandon; 10% Bulletin; 5% grad school prospective; 18% other
- NEW SITE:
  - 58% success rate

Overall results:

- New site efficiently bounced them to the appropriate area; but still went to the old places

Software:

- Usertesting.com - Full site with video and people thinking out loud; They have the test panel; Rate experience 1-10
- Usabilla - Click tracking on Flat Files; You provide the people (5-10 each test)
- Usabilitest - Not recommended; Though card sorting
- Loop11 - Full site; task based tracking

NO MOBILE USER TESTING….pushed off to the side because of timing; moving too fast, didn't want to do.
