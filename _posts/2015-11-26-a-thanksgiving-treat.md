With Thanksgiving right around the corner, my wife had the idea to make some mini apple pies to bring to the family gathering since we had leftover apples from [Backyard Orchard](https://www.facebook.com/BackyardOrchard/).

I&#8217;ve been using an apple pie recipe from the&nbsp;Moms Who Think website (no, it&#8217;s not&nbsp;_just_ for moms) and have fallen in love with the [Apple Crumb Pie](http://www.momswhothink.com/pie-recipes/apple-crumb-pie-recipe.html) and their [butter crust](http://www.momswhothink.com/pie-recipes/pie-crust-recipe.html) recipes. If I can make it, so can you.

For the mini apple pies, I simply followed the full recipes on the Moms Who Think site and altered the bake time. Following the recipes below, I made 18 mini apple pies and had enough to spare for two 7 oz and one 16oz Corningware Stoneware &#8220;pies.&#8221;

## Mini Apple Pie

### Flaky Butter Pie Crust Recipe (without shortening)

**Makes 2 single crusts**

**Ingredients:**

  * 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
  * 1/2 teaspoon salt
  * 1 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
  * 1/2 cup ice water (must be ice water to get a flaky, non-chewy crust)

**Directions:**

  1. Combine flour and salt in a large bowl. Cut in butter with a pastry blender until mixture is coarse crumbs. A pastry blender does the best job of combining the ingredients without overworking the dough.
  2. Sprinkle ice water, 1 Tablespoon at a time, evenly over flour mixture, tossing lightly with a fork until mixture forms an even ball of dough. Be sure to use a fork instead of your hands. You&#8217;ll avoid overworking/warming the dough.
  3. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for a minimum of 4 hours or overnight. Cold dough is an absolute must.
  4. Once cold, remove the dough from the plastic wrap and divide in half. Place one ball (wrapped in plastic) back into the refrigerator until you&#8217;re ready to roll it out.
  5. Roll the one ball of dough on a lightly floured surface, rolling into a circle about 12 to 14 inches round.
  6. Carefully fold in quarters, lift gently and unfold into 9-inch pie pan.
  7. Gently press pastry against bottom and sides of pan. Trim overhang to 1/2 inch, then fold the edge under. Pinch edges to flute.
