Earlier this week, I visited a wonderful little market here in Terre Haute. It&#8217;s name? Baesler&#8217;s Market.

While this is just a simple little grocery store, they have one unique thing. A &#8220;custom 6-pack&#8221; beer wall. I know, I know, some other stores have had this for a while. But, in Terre Haute it&#8217;s Kroger or Baesler&#8217;s.

While Kroger has a nice selection of Indiana Brews, Baesler&#8217;s has a better selection of Craft Beer&#8217;s, Indiana Brews and a variety of others. My goal is to head over and grab a 6-pack every now and again trying something new each time.

First up? Monty&#8217;s Python&#8217;s Holy Grail Ale.
