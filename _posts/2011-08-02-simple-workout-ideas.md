Everyone&#8217;s busy. How do you manage to get a workout in? Do you have an expensive gym membership? Do you just walk or run around your neighborhood? Or do you have trouble finding the motivation to do a workout?

Today, I&#8217;m going to give you just a few simple workout ideas using nothing but a resistance band, AKA Stretch Cords.

Resistance bands come in different lengths and resistance levels. The nice thing about using resistance bands is that you don&#8217;t have to worry about dropping something heavy on your foot, so this makes for a nice workout even when you are alone.

## Find the Bands that work for You

Luckily for the consumer, some giant supermarket stores have a variety pack of Resistance bands. The package that I purchased a few years back included 2 short bands, 2 long and some weird ankle thing (I never have used it) and handles.

This is great because you get multiple resistances easily, and you can adjust between sets or between various exercises. If one band is too light, switch to the other. Still not what you want? Use both!

## 3 Simple Workouts

In these workouts make sure you are slow and controlled. The best part about using the band is that you can truly feel when you are out of control.

  * **Bicep Curl** &#8211; Stand with your feet shoulder width apart (SWA) on the band. Make sure the band is tight enough to give you resistance while standing straight. Loop the band by your feet and stand on it to adjust resistance.
  * **Tricep Extension** &#8211; Stand w/feet SWA and pull the band over your head. Extend your arms until they are straight. I recommend keeping the band BEHIND you. Also, make sure to keep your elbows in towards your head.
  * **Figure 8&#8217;s** &#8211; Start with your arms at your side. Again Feet areÂ SWA. Make a figure 8 with your hand and arm. Your Palm should always be facing the way you are moving. This is very useful for people with Rotator Cuff problems.
  * **Others** &#8211; For more workout ideas with a Resistance band visit the <a title="Resistance Band Excercises" href="http://www.sportsinjuryclinic.net/strengthening/resistancebands.php">Sports Injury Clinic website</a>

All you have to do is couple this with some ab work and maybe a quick run and you&#8217;ve got a full body workout without ever having to go to the gym.

Now, these are some very simple workouts that you can do at home or even at the office for a short break. I wish you all the best and feel free to post any questions or comments below!
