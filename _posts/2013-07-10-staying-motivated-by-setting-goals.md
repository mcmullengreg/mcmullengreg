Everyone takes their eyes off the goal. Everyone. Who remembers Michael Phelps&#8217; incident after the 2008 Olympics? What about Ryan Lochte, did you even know he was debating skipping the 2016 Olympics, but recently [changed his mind](http://www.indystar.com/article/20130624/SPORTS/306240086/USA-Swimming-nationals-Ryan-Lochte-decides-he-s-serious-about-2016-Rio-Olympics)?

See, even gold medal athletes get distracted.

## Staying Motivated

There are thousands of articles on how to stay motivated. The best way to stay motivated is:

  1. Have someone push you
  2. Set goals
  3. Have FUN

Most athletes take the fun out of working out. Yes, it&#8217;s a workout. No it&#8217;s not always fun. How many people are like me and workout alone? Are you more motivated to workout the next time? Probably not. I&#8217;m not.

Having fun while working out OR having fun with your workout group is an easy way to stay motivated.

## Setting Goals

How great of a feeling is it to cross something off your &#8220;to-do list&#8221;? Create one with your workout! Keep yourself motivated by setting realistic and attainable workout goals. In the Patriot Mel Gipson tell&#8217;s his son &#8220;aim small, miss small.&#8221; While it&#8217;s slightly out of context, it still applies.

Set small attainable goals and keep yourself and others excited about what&#8217;s next!

## Make Workouts Fun!

For me, I work harder on challenging sets. Not just because they are challenging, but because they are fun. Coaches can motivate their athletes by creating challenging sets that make an athlete think. Individuals should create challenging and fun workout environments by creating games, goals and competitions between workout partners.

Some of the best workouts I ever got as an athlete were on game days. From water polo to Ultimate Frisbee (or Ultimate Med-Ball for those up to a true challenge) choose a game where you areÂ challenged mentally and physically.
