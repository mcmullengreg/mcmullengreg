The 2013-2014 season at Rose-Hulman ended better than I ever could have imagined. After breaking more than 20 records in the [2012-2013 season](http://gregoryamcmullen.com/2012/03/28/2011-2012-season-recap/ "2011-2012 Season Recap"), I never would have imagined breaking another 13. We sent two to the NCAA Division III National Championships.

Both swam well and <a title="Hong, Martin Earn All-American Honors at NCAA Nationals" href="http://www.rose-hulman.edu/athletics/swimming-diving/swimming-diving-stories/hong,-martin-earn-all-american-honors-at-ncaa-nationals.aspx">earned All-American status</a> by finishing in the top 8.

## Personal Challenges

This season was easier than last year.

From my point of view, I had a very successful season. I worked to understand the ideology behind the training structure, I trained starts and turns exclusively toward the end of the season and even had a stroke of genius, helping a freshman finish in the top 8 in a new event after observing his awesomeÂ back start.

Aside from that, I found a new coach to mentor. I&#8217;m extremely flattered that he sees me as his mentor, and I hope he continues to work in the swimming community.
