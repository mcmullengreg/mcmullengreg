This weekend I decided to head down to visit my girlfriend, who is attending IU Medical School, and while we know that living an hour apart is going to be tough we never realized how hard it was until today around 2:00.

She and I have been together for the last five years and honestly we&#8217;ve both been rather selfish with doing what we want instead of really thinking about one another. She wants to be a doctor, and I have no idea where my life is taking me. Right now I work in a fast paced environment working with Social Media, Websites and doing Technical Support for the Home Improvement Biz. However, I know that my heart&#8217;s not in it and I&#8217;m doing it really for the week to week paycheck. That&#8217;s why I recently picked up a job at Pike High School as an assistant swim coach.

This coaching job is more in target for what I want to do. The difficult thing that I&#8217;ll have to deal with is not being able to come home right after work, instead I&#8217;ll have to deal with going from work to practice, then finally home. I know it&#8217;s going to be time consuming, but I&#8217;m hoping that it&#8217;ll keep me entertained and active. I&#8217;m ready to do what I want to do, instead of what everyone is telling me I&#8217;m good at.

Sometimes you have to be willing to settle for what you can get. But once you realize what you really want to do make sure you chase after it. Give yourself a time line to achieve your goals just make sure it&#8217;s realistic. Start your business, go get a different degree or whatever, just know when it&#8217;s a wash. However, &#8220;if at first you don&#8217;t succeed. Try, try again.&#8221;
