I&#8217;m sitting on the bus on our way to Lawrence Central (and due to recent events the coaching staff needs to stagger their seating). I&#8217;m in the back of the bus with all the &#8220;close&#8221; swimmers you can really see the camaraderie between the team.

At the same time you can also feel the sense of disconnect between swimmers of different backgrounds. Both of our team captains are sitting in the back minding themselves while the younger and less experienced swimmers sit quietly on their own.

Hopefully by the end of the season we can make connections between the swimmers; especially the guys and girls. At the girls only meet they were laughing and having a good time. Today, we have limited interaction. Probably because the two teams cannot inter mix on the bus ride.

What&#8217;s the best way to promote team growth?
