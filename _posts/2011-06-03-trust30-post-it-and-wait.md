> That which each can do best, none but his Maker can teach him. Where is the master who could have taught Shakespeare? Where is the master who could have instructed Franklin, or Washington, or Bacon, or Newton? . . . Shakespeare will never be made by the study of Shakespeare. Do that which is assigned you, and you cannot hope too much or dare too much. – Ralph Waldo Emerson

Identify one of your biggest challenges at the moment (ie I don’t feel passionate about my work) and turn it into a question (ie How can I do work I’m passionate about?) Write it on a post-it and put it up on your bathroom mirror or the back of your front door. After 48-hours, journal what answers came up for you and be sure to evaluate them.

**Bonus:** tweet or blog a photo of your post-it.

If you&#8217;ve ever met me you&#8217;ve already realized that working with computers isn&#8217;t necessarily something I&#8217;m crazy about. It definitely used to be a passion and something I thought I wanted (hence the minor in IT in College). However, after working nearly two years in &#8220;the biz&#8221; I&#8217;ve realized it&#8217;s not for me.

Here are some things that I already know I need to figure out:

  * Do I need to go back to school?
  * How can I do what I love and get paid enough for it?
  * Can my dream job pay for my life expenses?
  * Where can I find the best resources for my dream?

Here in a few days I&#8217;m going to write up a blog post regarding my personal goals one of which will include my dream job.

What would your post-it note say? How would you go about overcoming the challenge?
