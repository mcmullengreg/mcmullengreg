This morning I decided to utilize some tools to figure out how I was doing from a Social Media perspective only to realize that I had (seemingly) lost 96 followers. Now I know that people on social media want to &#8220;read good stuff&#8221;, which is why I was trying to &#8220;share good stuff.&#8221; However, today just proved that I was failing at a few different aspects of what social media is. 

Instead of actually sharing something that people see as worthwhile I was (again, seemingly) boring the hell out of people, wasn&#8217;t engaging, nor was I engaging in very many conversations.

Now I want you all that may read this know that I want to improve in social media and want to work with you, learn from you and help add better posts to the Twitter, Facebook and blogging world. So with that here is my call out for help.
