> &#8220;Be more concerned with your character than your <a class="zem_slink" title="Reputation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reputation" rel="wikipedia">reputation</a>, because your character is what you really are, while your reputation is merely what others think you are.&#8221; - John Wooden

This quote really resonates with me. As I was tweeting back and forth with a few friends, there was a sense of  [humility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humility).

The reason this quote speaks to me so much is just that, you _should_ have humility. Let other people tell you that you do a good job. Ask for that recommendation letter or LinkedIn recommendation.
