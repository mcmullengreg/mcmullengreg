Breaststroke is a very strange stroke to swim due to the nature of the timing between the kick and pull and the performing the kick itself. Hopefully after reading this you will have a better sense of when kicks and pulls should start but you will also be able to take some drills out of this post.

### The Pull-down

The main difference that has occurred since I&#8217;ve been out of swimming is a downward dolphin kick during the breaststroke pull-down. The rules state that the &#8220;Pull Down must be initiated&#8221; before the kick. Basically what this means is that you have to break your streamline to kick. Since I trained without it I find it quite awkward to do but I can and do see the difference in my swimmers&#8217; breaststroke.

The pull-down consists of one full length arm pull (where the arms go straight down and flush against your side (there is&nbsp;a slight pause before you begin your kick and work your hands toward your head) and one kick. After which you are&nbsp;doing a normal breaststroke kick and pull cycle.

### The Arms

Breaststroke arms should have a &#8220;build&#8221; approach to them. They should hold for a short amount of time in a &#8220;streamline&#8221; type position with arms extended and your head in line at a neutral position.

Your arms should then separate to a little past shoulder width apart and with high elbows your hands should dip down into the water approaching your chest. From here, you should then raise your shoulders toward your ears to allow for an easier recovery where you should then pickup the speed to push your hands back out in front of you. **You should NEVER pause while your hands are at your chest.**

### The Breath

breaststroke breathing is not a complicated process as you will be breathing with every cycle. The only source of confusion I&#8217;ve seen is WHEN to breathe. When your hands are dipping under the water you are&nbsp;pushing enough water under you to bring your head and chest out of the water. One rule that we use is that the coaching staff should never be able to see your face when you breathe. So basically, you need to keep your head at a neutral position and not lift your head out of the water. Use your arms to LIFT your body out of the water.

### The Kick

Kicking in breaststroke isn&#8217;t as difficult as it may look. The most common way of teaching this kick is the &#8220;Up &#8211; Out &#8211; Around&#8221; approach.

  * **UP** &#8211; Your feet go up towards your rear end
  * **Out** &#8211; Your _feet_ turn outward keeping your knees together
  * **Around** &#8211; Leading with your feet you bring them around and together (using the insoles of your foot to propel you). Always make sure to finish that kick (your feet can and should touch)

### The Drills

**Two-Count Glide Drill**

Hold the streamlined (stretched) position of the stroke for a full count of two (one alligator, two alligator). Keep your head down and neck straight. In the breaststroke, be sure not to stop your hands under your body, but only in the extended position. Then, start the pull slowly, pitching the hands outward until they are shoulder width apart, and then accelerate your hands through the power phase (the in sweep), continuing all the way through to the recovery.

It&#8217;s a good idea to combine this drill with double underwater pull-outs to increase the feel of gliding in the streamline position.

**Two-Kick / One-Pull Drill**

Hold the streamline for a second kick in each stroke. While doing the second kick, allow your hands to separate slowly to press your head and chest lower in the water. Keep your chin down, and look down at the bottom of the pool. This will prepare you for a more powerful in-sweep and recovery.

**Two-Pull / One-Kick Drill**

Take a powerful pull swinging the hips forward and under your torso and then throw your hands into the recovery / streamline while making an exaggerated dolphin kick. Repeat the powerful pull but kick a breaststroke kick. Alternate between the two kicks. Notice the hip motion is&nbsp;the similar for the&nbsp;dolphin and breaststroke kick.

**One-Pull / Dolphin-Kick / One-Kick Drill**

As with the drill above, take one powerful pull and throw the hands into the recovery while executing a strong dolphin kick. Then, hold the streamline position with the upper body and arms as you execute a powerful breaststroke kick. This drill also emphasizes the hip movement, streamline position of the arm recovery, and power of the kick.

**Opposite Hand / Foot Drill**

Pull with your left hand only, keeping your right arm extended out front, and kick with your right leg only, keeping your left leg extended out back. Repeat this drill using the right hand and left leg. This drill takes practice, but you will gain a better feel for the &#8220;short-axis&#8221; nature of the breaststroke.
