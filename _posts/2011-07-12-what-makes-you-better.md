I was recently interviewed for a head coach jobÂ at my old swim club, [South Dearborn Swimming](http://southdearbornswimming.org/). I surprised myself when I was asked the question.

> What makes you different/better than the next person that we bring in?

My response, &#8220;Nothing.&#8221;

## What the @#$^% are you thinking?

How am I supposed to know what makes me different from people I&#8217;ve never met? For all I know they could be 30 years old and have coached for 15 years, am I better than them? No.

What truly sets me apart, in my mind, is that I&#8217;ve found what I&#8217;m passionate about. Swimming was my first love when it came to athletics. It brought about some of the best times in my life and created the tightest bond with a great group of friends that I will always have by my side.
