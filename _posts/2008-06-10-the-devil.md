So, as I am sitting at work today I am trying to design a new website (can&#8217;t tell you which one because it&#8217;s a secret). As I am programming the code I switch to render the site in IE (Internet Explorer for those that don&#8217;t know) and the site COMPLETELY CRAPPED OUT. Thus&#8230;IE = the Devil.

I cannot believe this, but it reassured my love for Mozilla Firefox. Which everyone should download, here is a link. <http://www.mozilla.com/>

Thank you come again!

Edit: This homework for Ireland is a pain in the butt&#8230;
