So here I am, looking at a blank screen, trying to figure out what to write. But instead, I'm just going to leave you (and myself) with a simple quote from Coach Cal Stoll, former football coach at the University of Minnesota.

> Success is uncommon and not to be enjoyed by the common man. I’m looking for uncommon people because we want to be successful, not average. – Coach Cal Stoll
