Proper stroke technique is obtained by utilizing a strong underwater catch, pull-through, recovery and a strong flutter-style kick.

## The Catch

A swimmers hand is a paddle. The idea of the catch in freestyle is to stretch your arm and hand from your shoulder and set an anchor in the water out in front of your head and body. The arm is fully extended and your body rotated slightly to one side (never on your side fully; but still allowing for a long reach).

During the catch the swimmer needs to concentrate on keeping the fingers together and wrist inline with the forearm. You should also keep a high elbow to allow for a deep and full catch that will lead you into a solid underwater pull.

## The Pull-Through

For the pull a swimmer should concentrate on moving their body through the water using gravity and a sense of hydrodynamics. Your hands will naturally be pulled towards the bottom of the pull and you should not immediately fight this urge. The underwater pull through should maximize the hand and forearm to grab a large amount of water to &#8220;throw down&#8221;. The pull is a straight pull and should not create a shape or &#8220;S&#8221; pattern as this just disturbs water unnecessarily.

Also, make sure that your arm is slightly extended down to your waist to prepare for the recovery phase of the stroke.

## The Recovery

A free style recovery should once again embrace the force of gravity. Personally, I believe that a minor &#8220;flair&#8221; when exiting the water gives slightly more force behind the recovery.

Swimmers should then concentrate on a high elbow recovery where your hand is always lower than your elbow. Rotate your body to the proper side and fully extend your arm with your fingertips breaking the water&#8217;s surface first. One should never smack the hand or forearm in the water, but should gently ease fingertips, wrist, forearm, elbow into the water without dipping the hand or crossing over. (See my post about fixing [shoulder pain due to improper stroke here]({% post_url 2011-01-06-common-freestyle-backstroke-mistakes %}))

## The Kick

Freestyle is a leg driven stroke. Major shoulder injuries can occur (believe me, I know) due to a poor kick causing a swimmer to over use their arms.

Flutter Kick is the type of kick used in both Freestyle and Backstroke and should encompass about a 6-1 ratio in normal swimming conditions (even in competition). This means that for every single arm cycle you should be kicking 6 times.

## Breathing in Freestyle

Breathing in freestyle is not nearly as difficult as some people may think. The goal is to take a breath without lifting your head out of the water. A good ratio to is a 3 strokes to 1 breath as this teaches bilateral breathing. This is accomplished by doing the following:

  * Hold the wall with arms outstretched using a flutter kick to keep your body afloat
  * Turn your head to the left and right as needed to breath; Making sure one eye is still under the water and positioning your mouth as needed to get a breath
  * Still on the wall; Take a stroke while turning your head to breath
  * Use a kick board with the same technique above with strokes
  * Put it all together 
      * One thing I like to tell my swimmers is to use your shoulders to &#8220;push&#8221; your chin back in line through the stoke. This will help improve your breath timing.

## Drills

  * **Breath Control:** Concentrate on Breathing every 3, 5, 7 or 9 strokes to increase lung capacity
  * **Arizona Kick Series:** 18 kicks &#8211; 2 Stokes; 16 &#8211; 2; 12 &#8211; 2 (fast kicks; moderate arms, 12 &#8211; 2 is a normal 6-beat kick)
  * **One Armed Swim:** With one arm at your side alternate strokes per 25; Concentrate on Body Roll and Arm Position.
