For the last three weeks, I&#8217;ve been working towards finding my own way. The people at Rose-Hulman have made my transition extremely easy and incredibly fun. 

I&#8217;ve been introduced to a large group of people and have already been given a large project that will change the way this school looks at social media. I&#8217;m looking forward to getting it off the ground. 

This new position I&#8217;m in has been a very large change compared to where I was previously, they are embracing technology and putting the latest and greatest tools in front of me. Giving me the best opportunity to succeed. Heck, I&#8217;m typing this post on a brand new iPad. 

I am so grateful for my past experiences, but I am looking forward to all of the new challenges that lie ahead of me.
