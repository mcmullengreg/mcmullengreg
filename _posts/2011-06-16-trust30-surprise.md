> I will not hide my tastes or aversions. I will so trust that what is deep is holy, if we follow the truth, it will bring us out safe at last. – Ralph Waldo Emerson

Think of a time when you didn’t think you were capable of doing something, but then surprised yourself. How will you surprise yourself this week?

You want to know something about me? I don&#8217;t run, ever! Running is my Kryptonite. The reason I have such a problem with it is:

  * I have bad knees
  * I have a bad back
  * I hate it
  * It makes me feel like death
  * It just plain sucks&#8230;

So you can imagine what I was thinking when my beautiful girlfriend says &#8220;Greg, \___\___ and \___\___ want us to join them in the [Redlegs Run](http://mlb.mlb.com/cin/community/race.jsp). Of course, me being the guy that I am I tell her &#8220;okay!&#8221; This is also when I had JUST received my new Nike+ Running System and I thought I would use it all the time&#8230;.not so much.

## &#8220;Training..&#8221;

Now, here I am donning my brand new Nike Shox (which I do love), my new iPod Nano and my Nike+ hitting the gym just about every day for about&#8230;oh&#8230;2 weeks (maybe 3). I was utilizing the Coach/Training program that the system had suggested for running a 10k to make sure I had some stamina for the races. Oh yeah, did I mention we registered for BOTH the 10k and 5k&#8230;

Needless to say, my training didn&#8217;t go well&#8230;

## Closer to the Race&#8230;

Sarah starts hitting me with the &#8220;you should probably start running so you are ready for the race!&#8221; I just shrugged it off and said I&#8217;d be fine. She was running about 2 miles 3-4 times a week, whereas I just wanted to lounge around after getting off of work.

Honestly, she was right I should have worked harder for the race.

## The Night Before and Race Day&#8230;

Friday before the race I headed out to my parent&#8217;s house to drop off some of my non-essential running gear and spent some time with my dad. He asked me &#8220;are you ready for the race?&#8221; I immediately replied, &#8220;heck no, I&#8217;m just gonna give it my best.&#8221;

Later that evening, I headed over to Sarah&#8217;s parents house and right before bed I tweeted out (after taking some Alieve and using IcyHot on my back and knee):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Not looking forward to the run tomorrow...total is 15k...I might die. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wishmeluck?src=hash">#wishmeluck</a></p>&mdash; Greg McMullen (@McMullen_Greg) <a href="https://twitter.com/McMullen_Greg/status/79379784316100608">June 11, 2011</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
