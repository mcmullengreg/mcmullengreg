Greg McMullen is a husband, dad, dog owner, web developer and [former] swim coach . This should give you everything you need to know, his first priority is being a loving husband and father to his wife, daughter and, of course, their dog.

##Greg McMullen, Web Developer

In August 2014 Greg joined the Office of Marketing and Communications staff at his alma mater, Xavier University (Cincinnati, OH), as a web developer. The job has been a mix of projects so far with his first being a complete design overhaul of the Road to Xavier website, an admitted student portal. This project started on day one and had a quick deadline of October. With help from the team, the project has been a success.

Prior to joining Xavier University, Greg worked for Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology (Terre Haute, IN) as a web assistant and later a web manager. He had a lot of success in growing the social media presence on campus, with the biggest success story being aiding the president in his own social media campaign. Other projects included developing custom macros (for Umbraco: Embedded Twitter Widget and Form Wrangler) and creating a new campus and alumni data map.

But how did he get to where he is today? Well, thanks to Unique Home Solutions (formerly Unique Window and Door) , in good ol’ Indianapolis, IN for providing nearly three years of work. Greg started in their IT department, and eventually found his way into online marketing.

##Coach Greg McMullen

Greg’s first experience with “coaching” started during his own swim career. He began working with bronze level athletes for South Dearborn Swimming (now Sea Dragons Swimming). Little did he know the path that would follow.

In 2010, Greg began looking for a program to work with in the Indianapolis area. After a few weeks he landed a job as an assistant coach at Pike High School. In the two years at Pike, he worked with the entire squad starting with newer athletes and finishing his stint with writing workouts and meet lineups for the entire team. In both seasons, he saw team records fall and had multiple athletes attend the IHSAA state meet.

Prior to his second season, Greg joined the staff of the Red Devil Aquatic Club (USA Swimming) to work with the Stroke School (10 & under) and Novice (11-12) athletes. Prior to and after the high school season, Greg began working with the senior athletes until leaving for Rose-Hulman (NCAA).

In his first season with Rose-Hulman Swimming & Diving, Greg focused on technique improvements across the board primarily in starts and turns. He was given the freedom to work with the athletes two days a week improving speed and techniques off blocks and walls. In the two years working with Rose-Hulman the team earned 30+ school records, 24 All-Conference Award Winners, four All-Academic team awards, four NCAA Division III national qualifying bids and two All-Americans (Swimming and Diving Headlines).

After parting ways with Rose-Hulman, Greg joined the Northern Kentucky Clippers for the second half of the season but decided to put his coaching aspirations aside while tending to his wife and young family.
