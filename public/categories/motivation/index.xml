      <description>People look towards family and close friends for support. How often do these requests get laughed at? Ignored? Supported? Or encouraged? No matter the outcome, these situations strengthen connections and can often help when reaching your full potential.

      <description>Everyone takes their eyes off the goal. Everyone. Who remembers Michael Phelps&amp;#8217; incident after the 2008 Olympics? What about Ryan Lochte, did you even know he was debating skipping the 2016 Olympics, but recently changed his mind?
See, even gold medal athletes get distracted.
 Obstacles are what you see when you take your eyes off the goal. - Vince Lombardi
