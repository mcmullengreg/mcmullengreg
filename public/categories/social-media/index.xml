      <description>In an effort to improve my writing skills and to post more frequently I have decided to join the #Trust30 effort. Luckily I won&amp;#8217;t have to be too creative as there will be prompts for me to write about. Today&amp;#8217;s prompt by Gwen Bell is &amp;#8220;15 Minutes to Live&amp;#8221;
 &amp;#8220;We are afraid of truth, afraid of fortune, afraid of death, and afraid of each other. Our age yields no great and perfect persons.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m sure that you&amp;#8217;ve heard the old phrase &amp;#8220;Don&amp;#8217;t Judge a book by it&amp;#8217;s cover&amp;#8221; but is that really how we operate? I know that I am guilty of judging someone based on their looks.
When we are looking for something or someone we look at links, videos, and images. What I want to talk about is your personal appearance, particularly in your online avatar. If you were to show up to an interview in a pair of ripped jeans, a dirty polo and basketball shoes would you be received the same as if you were to show up wearing a professionally cleaned and tailored suit?</description>
