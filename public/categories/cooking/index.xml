      <description>With Thanksgiving right around the corner, my wife had the idea to make some mini apple pies to bring to the family gathering since we had leftover apples from Backyard Orchard.
I&amp;#8217;ve been using an apple pie recipe from the&amp;nbsp;Moms Who Think website (no, it&amp;#8217;s not&amp;nbsp;just for moms) and have fallen in love with the Apple Crumb Pie and their butter crust recipes. If I can make it, so can you.</description>

      <description>Decided to make another new recipe with Sarah this week. From a pampered chef cook book.
A very colorful meal with lots of fresh veggies.
