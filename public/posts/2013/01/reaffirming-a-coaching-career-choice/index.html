                <p>Recently, I received a series of text messages from a former swimmer. I only coached this athlete for two high school seasons and not only did he have an impact on my life, but these messages clearly showed that I had an impact on his as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey Coach Greg! I just wanted to shoot you a quick text here. I just wanted to let you know how grateful I was to have had you as my head coach senior year. I know this might be a little late, but my family and I were discussing swim season and I was describing my senior season to them and out of all the sports and coaches I have had you were the most inspiring to me. You inspired a goof of a kid with some talent to put his mind and will to a sport and team and I will always appreciate that. You taught me valuable life lessons that I will carry for the rest of my life…senior year was such a blast and seeing you behind us not only as a coach but as friends too meant a lot to me. Seeing you get emotional at conference truly I feel was the moment that defined you as a coach. Emotional, yet reserved and fully supportive of everybody on the team. Not just varsity, but also JV. Even if you may have some things you would&#8217;ve changed or done differently if you had a second chance, just know that I wouldn&#8217;t have changed a single thing. That season, that team was the best of my high school career. You believed in me when other coaches didn&#8217;t, and sometimes that&#8217;s all someone really needs is someones belief in them. The only thing I might have changed is to have you as my coach for my whole high school career (haha). I just thought I should give a long deserved thanks from me to you Coach Greg. I hope that you have luck in coaching because you&#8217;re one damn good coach.</p>

<p>Comments like this help reaffirm a coaching career choice. Because of these athletes I will always make the time and invest in their success.</p>

<p>Who have you heard from and what have they said to make what you do mean even more?</p>
