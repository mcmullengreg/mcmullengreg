<h2 id="give-it-a-rest">Give it a ReST</h2>

<p><strong>What is ReST</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>REpresentational State Transfer</li>
<li>Uniform interface</li>
<li>Stateless</li>
<li>Cacheable</li>
<li>Client-Server</li>
<li>Layered System</li>
<li>Code on Demand (optional)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Getting Started</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>WPPusher (optional)</li>
<li>WP API Plugin</li>
<li>Authentication plugin (oAuth, Basic, Cookie)

<ul>
<li>If Basic, install Application Passwords Plugin</li>
</ul></li>
<li>SearchWP API Route plugin (optional)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What can it to</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Pull from WordPress, into</p>

<ul>
<li>WP Sites</li>
<li>Native mobile app</li>
<li>Non-WordPress sites</li>
<li>Digital Signage</li>
<li>Wherever, anything that can take Structured data can use the API</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Push to WordPress</p>

<ul>
<li>requires authorization</li>
<li>Allows management of WordPress data from external sources</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why use the ReST API?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>You request what you want; and it comes in it&rsquo;s own bucket</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t have to build the HTML you are receiving it from; but on the end it&rsquo;s being consumed.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hurdles</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Very little included in core, need a few additional plugins</li>
<li>Meta data is protected; need to authenticate to get it</li>
<li>Authenticating is challenging</li>
<li>Custom endpoints for custom content</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hacking-examples">Hacking Examples</h2>

<h3 id="a1-injection">A1. Injection</h3>

<ul>
<li>Untrusted, tainted data is sent to interpreter as part of a command or query.</li>
<li>Interpreter is tricked into executing unintended commands</li>
</ul>

<p>Why does it happen? Failure to separate untrusted data with commands sent to an interpreter. Lack of validation and/or input sanitation</p>

<p>Broken Authentication and Session Management
Cross Site Scripting XSS
Insecure Direct Object Reference</p>

<h3 id="a2-broken-authentication-and-session-management">A2. Broken Authentication and Session Management</h3>

<ul>
<li>Failure to protect credentials and session tokens throughout the lifecycle of the session</li>
<li>Weak authentication logic</li>
<li>Imperfect implementation</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why does it happen:</strong>
- Passing the session ID as a parameter
- Predictable value for the session ID
- User credentials passed unencrypted
- Poor username/password recovery</p>

<p>User Tamper Data to reverse hash SessionIDs</p>

<ul>
<li>Never Send credentials/sensitive data in the clear; use SSL</li>
<li>Protect secrets throughout their lifecycle

<ul>
<li>don&rsquo;t expose credentials in logs/URL etc</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use centralized authentication and session management APIs</li>
<li>Use a different sessionID after authentication or whenever authorization/permission levels change</li>
<li>Destroy sessions completely</li>
<li>Enforce session timeouts</li>
<li>Protect against Cross-Site scripting

<ul>
<li>can be used to scrape data</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="a3-cross-site-scripting-xss">A3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Similar to injection, but targets a browser.</li>
<li>Comes in Client side scripts (JS)</li>
<li>Occurs when an application takes untrusted data from the user and goes back to the browser without validation or encoding</li>
<li>Exploits the trust the user has for a site</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why does it happen:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Failure to separate; lack of validation and sanitation</li>
<li>Able to change executed commands</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="types">Types</h4>

<p><strong>Reflected:</strong>
- Data from the URL is used in the creation of the page
- Attacker tricks the user to click the exploited URL</p>

<p><strong>Stored/Persistent</strong>
- Injected script is stored on the target server
- Script is then sent to visitors of the site
- Broswer then executes the injected script
- Delayed (&lsquo;blind&rsquo;) refers to the payload being executed at a later time; Possibly in a completely different system.</p>

<p><strong>Dom-based</strong></p>

<p>Similar to reflected but tricks legitimate client script into executing the payload</p>

<h4 id="prevention">Prevention</h4>

<ul>
<li>Implicitly deny</li>
<li>Validate all input, regardless of where it comes from</li>
<li>Context-based output encoding

<ul>
<li>entity based attributes; encode based on the context they&rsquo;ll be used</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Content-Security Policy Headers</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="insecure-direct-object-references">Insecure Direct Object References</h3>

<p>What is it?</p>

<p>Exposing something that isn&rsquo;t protected via server side items.</p>

<p>Prevention: Don&rsquo;t expose internal keys or identifiers
Use object reference that is hard to guess
Perform server-side auth</p>

<p>Prevention
- Security hardening through the entire application
- Change default passwords
- Remove debugging messages and overly informative error messages in production
- Remove unnecessary/unused features/modules/components</p>

<h3 id="sensitive-data-exposire">Sensitive Data Exposire</h3>

<ul>
<li>Storing and transmitting sensitive data insecurely:

<ul>
<li>Failure to identify all sensitive data</li>
<li>Failure to identify locations of sensitive data (DB; backups; logs)</li>
<li>Failure to identify all locations data is sent</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>EX: debugging information in comments of output sent to the browser</p>

<p>Application stores data correctly; but logging is insecure</p>

<p>Prevention:
- Don&rsquo;t store sensitive information if you don&rsquo;t need it.
- Catalog all sensitive data and where it&rsquo;s used
- Disable caching of pages that contain sensitive data
- Encrypt all sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Use strong standard algos and keys</p>

<h3 id="missing-function-level-access-controls">Missing Function Level Access Controls</h3>

<ul>
<li>Enforce authorization</li>
<li>Attacker notices the URL structure indicates his role. Modifies it to another role</li>
</ul>

<p>Prevent - Deny by default &amp;&amp; implicit deny
- Perform server side checks for every action
- Do not rely on data from the user</p>

<h3 id="cross-site-request-forgery">Cross-Site request Forgery</h3>

<ul>
<li>Victim&rsquo;s browser is tricked into issuing commands to a vulnerable web application, to perform unwanted action on a trusted site for which the user is authenticated</li>
<li>Browser automatically include credentials with request, even for requests initiated by a form, script or image</li>
<li>Server side code process requests as if they came from the</li>
</ul>

<p>Prevention:
- Eliminate all XSS vulnerabilities
- Never allow changes via GET requests
- Check origin and referrer (check the page that made the change) headers as a first step.
- Include a per-request, cryptographically strong or random token to all forms, verify token on the server</p>

<h3 id="using-components-with-known-vulnerabilities">Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities</h3>

<p>Using third party controls/modules/frameworks with known vulnerabilities anywhere in the stack can be discovered and exploited by automated tools
- 3rd party frameworks.</p>

<p>Prevention:</p>

<ul>
<li>Catalog what you have in your stack</li>
<li>Disable or remove unused plugins</li>
<li>Monitor everything</li>
<li>Keep components up-to-date</li>
<li>Develop a security policy on third-party plugins</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="unvalidated-redirects-and-forwards">Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards</h3>

<ul>
<li>Application takes input from an external source that is then used to formulate a redirection or forward location without validation.</li>
<li>Attacker links to an unvalidated redirect and tricks victim into clicking it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Prevention:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t use them unless you have to</li>
<li>Avoid using user inputs to determine destination URL</li>
<li>Whitelist allowed pages or external sites</li>
<li>Ensure URL is valid and authorized</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>

<ul>
<li>Security is a process, not an event</li>
<li>Build security into the development life-cycle a the beginning</li>
<li>Be paranoid; be skeptical</li>

<li><p>Treat all data as tainted</p>

<ul>
<li>Validate first (whitelist), then filter (blacklist)</li>
<li>Validate/clean as early as possible</li>
<li>Encode data appropriately</li>
<li>Do not rely on user input</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Defense-in-depth: Put as many layers in front as you possibly can. Either exhaust their resources (attacker) or make them lose interest in you.</p></li>

<li><p>Principle of Least privilege</p>

<ul>
<li>Limit access to everything</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Enforce strong passwords</p></li>

<li><p>Don&rsquo;t hardcode secrets in source</p></li>

<li><p>Keep 3rd party components updated</p></li>

<li><p>Error handling and debug info.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>grep for eval or grep for preg_replace(&lsquo;SOMETHING&rsquo;/e)</p>

<p>SANS security.
Fortify and IBM App Scan</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="building-cultures-and-pushing-code">Building Cultures and Pushing Code</h2>

<p>Keep doing: Accessibility project - mainly because it&rsquo;s the right thing to do and do right.
Do more: Application-style development.
Do less: monotonous tasks; basic web updates.
Start: Web App project for a current student portal
Stop: Working on crap code &ldquo;just to get it done.&rdquo;</p>

            <description>For April Fool&amp;rsquo;s day we decided to &amp;ldquo;launch&amp;rdquo; a new major, Emoji as a Second Language. Cute right? I thought so too, until the request came in for social share buttons.
In most cases, you&amp;rsquo;d just use the default social share buttons, right? Right.
Well, I&amp;rsquo;m better than that so I decided to expand upon the effort and create my own social share buttons (with the help of a certain search engine).</description>

<p>For April Fool&rsquo;s day we decided to &ldquo;launch&rdquo; a new major, <a href="http://www.xavier.edu/emoji" target="_blank">Emoji as a Second Language</a>. Cute right? I thought so too, until the request came in for social share buttons.</p>

<p>In most cases, you&rsquo;d just use the default social share buttons, right? Right.</p>

<p>Well, I&rsquo;m better than that so I decided to expand upon the effort and create my own social share buttons (with the help of a certain search engine). I&rsquo;ll post some resources a bit further down.</p>

<p>Twitter was a piece of cake. Especially after finding the content from WebPop (4) and expanding on the URL parameters with Twitter&rsquo;s documentation (3).</p>

<p>Facebook, however gave me some trouble. The StackOverflow article provided the direction, but Facebook&rsquo;s Open Graph tags are where I started to get stressed out.</p>

<h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2>

<p>Facebook has a great <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/og/object/" target="_blank">debugging tool</a>. It&rsquo;s available on their developers site for anyone to use. What&rsquo;s not great, is how the scraper actually works. I was able to define all of the meta tags as required, as seen below.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;<span style="color:#f92672">meta</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">property</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;og:url&#34;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">content</span><span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/19/arts/international/when-great-minds-dont-think-alike.html&#34;</span> /&gt;

<p>When I used the debugging tool, my OG tags were defined but the defined content wasn&rsquo;t pulled in properly. Mainly claiming that the photo couldn&rsquo;t be downloaded.</p>

<p>After checking the actual <code>og:description</code> my text was <code>Study the system of communication that's universal in the only program of it’s kind.</code> As I reviewed the content, I noticed the <code>it’s</code> wasn&rsquo;t the HTML safe apostrophe so I changed it.</p>

<p><strong>No Dice</strong></p>

<p>After a bit longer, I realized the apostrophe in <code>that's</code> looked right, but I changed it out anyway. And guess what&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Hallelujah, it&rsquo;s fixed</strong></p>

            <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about different ways to redevelop my personal site. Since joining Xavier in 2014, I&amp;rsquo;ve been isolated in the Campus Suite CMS, which has it&amp;rsquo;s ups and downs much like many CMS&amp;rsquo; out there.
After doing a site evaluation, I determined that WordPress isn&amp;rsquo;t meeting my needs anymore. But it&amp;rsquo;s nothing that WordPress has done, it&amp;rsquo;s about me and taking care of my site. Working with WordPress Themes can be a complicated mess, plus there&amp;rsquo;s the database that needs attention.</description>

<p>After doing a site evaluation, I determined that WordPress isn&rsquo;t meeting my needs anymore. But it&rsquo;s nothing that WordPress has done, it&rsquo;s about me and taking care of my site. Working with WordPress Themes can be a complicated mess, plus there&rsquo;s the database that needs attention.</p>

<p>Throughout all of this, I determined that I didn&rsquo;t want to deal with a database driven system anymore. That&rsquo;s where Jekyll comes in.</p>

<p>Jekyll is a database free, static website generator that I can run locally on my laptop. While it doesn&rsquo;t allow me to use programming languages (such as PHP or ColdFusion) to generate any dynamic content, I don&rsquo;t care. I get enough experience at writing those things in personal and work-related projects.</p>

<p>This site is going to be simplified, but I will work on loading old posts and comments from the WordPress site for historical reference.</p>

<p>Hope you enjoy the new look and (hopefully) a better experience.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I used to build the site:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://bourbon.io" target="_blank">Bourbon</a> and <a href="http://neat.bourbon.io" target="_blank">Neat</a></li>

            <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on revising the code for OurMenuMaker.com and had been struggling with setting the project up properly.
After looking at different PHP based projects, I determined that I should look into defining my structure similar to the following:
. ├── public_html | ├── css | ├── js | ├── images | └── index.php ├── includes | └── config.php  The end product will be much more sophisticated, but this is why I started researching how to set the include path.</description>

<p>The end product will be much more sophisticated, but this is why I started researching how to set the include path.</p>

<p>For 1and1.com hosting, the include path needs to be set similarly to:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-php" data-lang="php">    include_path = .:/usr/lib/php5.5:/kunden/homepages/XX/XXXXXXXX/htdocs/PATH/TO/YOUR/PROJECT</code></pre></div>
<p>I modified the <code>php.ini</code> file in my project directory and also set the folder/file permissions as appropriate.</p>

            <description>With Thanksgiving right around the corner, my wife had the idea to make some mini apple pies to bring to the family gathering since we had leftover apples from Backyard Orchard.
I&amp;#8217;ve been using an apple pie recipe from the&amp;nbsp;Moms Who Think website (no, it&amp;#8217;s not&amp;nbsp;just for moms) and have fallen in love with the Apple Crumb Pie and their butter crust recipes. If I can make it, so can you.</description>

<p>With Thanksgiving right around the corner, my wife had the idea to make some mini apple pies to bring to the family gathering since we had leftover apples from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BackyardOrchard/" target="_blank">Backyard Orchard</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using an apple pie recipe from the&nbsp;Moms Who Think website (no, it&#8217;s not&nbsp;<em>just</em> for moms) and have fallen in love with the <a href="http://www.momswhothink.com/pie-recipes/apple-crumb-pie-recipe.html" target="_blank">Apple Crumb Pie</a> and their <a href="http://www.momswhothink.com/pie-recipes/pie-crust-recipe.html" target="_blank">butter crust</a> recipes. If I can make it, so can you.</p>

<p>For the mini apple pies, I simply followed the full recipes on the Moms Who Think site and altered the bake time. Following the recipes below, I made 18 mini apple pies and had enough to spare for two 7 oz and one 16oz Corningware Stoneware &#8220;pies.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="mini-apple-pie">Mini Apple Pie</h2>

<h3 id="flaky-butter-pie-crust-recipe-without-shortening">Flaky Butter Pie Crust Recipe (without shortening)</h3>

<p><strong>Makes 2 single crusts</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>2 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</li>
<li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup ice water (must be ice water to get a flaky, non-chewy crust)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Directions:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Combine flour and salt in a large bowl. Cut in butter with a pastry blender until mixture is coarse crumbs. A pastry blender does the best job of combining the ingredients without overworking the dough.</li>
<li>Sprinkle ice water, 1 Tablespoon at a time, evenly over flour mixture, tossing lightly with a fork until mixture forms an even ball of dough. Be sure to use a fork instead of your hands. You&#8217;ll avoid overworking/warming the dough.</li>
<li>Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for a minimum of 4 hours or overnight. Cold dough is an absolute must.</li>
<li>Once cold, remove the dough from the plastic wrap and divide in half. Place one ball (wrapped in plastic) back into the refrigerator until you&#8217;re ready to roll it out.</li>
<li>Roll the one ball of dough on a lightly floured surface, rolling into a circle about 12 to 14 inches round.</li>
<li>Carefully fold in quarters, lift gently and unfold into 9-inch pie pan.</li>
<li>Gently press pastry against bottom and sides of pan. Trim overhang to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inch, then fold the edge under. Pinch edges to flute.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h3 id="apple-crumb-pie">Apple Crumb Pie</h3>

<p><strong>Filling Ingredients:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>3&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> pounds&nbsp;Granny Smith, Cortland, Jonagold&nbsp;apples, peeled, cored,&nbsp;sliced</li>
<li>1 Tablespoon lemon juice</li>
<li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> cup sugar</li>
<li><sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> teaspoon cinnamon, ground</li>
<li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> teaspoon nutmeg, ground</li>
<li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Crumb Topping Ingredients:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup brown sugar, firmly packed</li>
<li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;teaspoon nutmeg, ground</li>
<li>1&nbsp;cup flour</li>
<li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> cup butter, chilled, cut in pieces</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Directions:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to&nbsp;375 degrees F.</li>
<li>To make crust: mix together flour and salt in a medium bowl.</li>
<li>Use a pastry blender or 2 knives to cut the shortening into the flour mixture until coarse crumbs are formed.</li>
<li>Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with a fork, until a dough forms.</li>
<li>Shape into a flat circle then wrap in plastic wrap and chill for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>On a floured surface, roll dough with a floured rolling pin. Using a cookie cutter or a glass, cut the pie crust to fit your muffin tin.</li>
<li>To prepare filling:&nbsp; in a large bowl, toss together lemon juice, apples, sugar,&nbsp;nutmeg, cinnamon and salt. Spoon mixture evenly into crust.</li>
<li>To prepare topping: mix together brown sugar, nutmeg and flour in a small bowl.</li>
<li>Use a pastry blender or 2 knives to cut the butter into the brown sugar mixture until coarse crumbs form.</li>
<li>Sprinkle the crumb topping evenly over the&nbsp;filling to cover completely.</li>
<li>Bake for 30-40 minutes (mine took 35 minutes).</li>

            <description>While working on the redevelopment for the Xavier University V4 project. I&amp;rsquo;ve determined that I needed to get a better understanding of the various components that I&amp;rsquo;m using to manage the project. One of the components is Bower. I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite grasp the idea between a dependency and a devDependency within pacakge.json.
Luckily I&amp;rsquo;m not the only person that had no idea.
 Dependencies - Intended for use in production, and implied that it will be required for development purposes too.</description>

            <description>After a beginning minor development in PHP for the temp v4 project, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to go ahead and install a ColdFusion development server locally to begin developing the template in ColdFusion.
Luckily I&amp;rsquo;ve had some experience converting PHP to ColdFusion, although it was rather simple since all I used were a few variables to determine what stylesheet loaded on the page and a few includes.
Header Improvements While it may not seem significant, I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to do some cleanup with the actual HTML code for the header file.</description>

<p>After a beginning minor development in PHP for the temp v4 project, I&rsquo;ve decided to go ahead and install a ColdFusion development server locally
to begin developing the template in ColdFusion.</p>

<p>Luckily I&rsquo;ve had some experience converting PHP to ColdFusion, although it was rather simple since all I used were a few variables to determine what
stylesheet loaded on the page and a few includes.</p>

<h2 id="header-improvements">Header Improvements</h2>

<p>While it may not seem significant, I&rsquo;ve been able to do some cleanup with the actual HTML code for the header file. Instead of dropping in two different
navigation elements for Mobile and Desktop, I was able to create a new header combining the two using <code>flexbox</code> instead of Bootstrap, or an inefficient
<code>position:absolute</code> structure.</p>

<p>While I did have to use <code>position:absolute</code> to bring up the main <code>nav</code> in the desktop version. The remainder of the site is in <code>flex</code></p>

<h2 id="stylesheets">Stylesheets</h2>

<p>Styles will be written in SCSS format. We&rsquo;re using a three stylesheet format:
1. Global.scss - Header Footer and all of the necessary layouts.
2. Theme.scss - CMS specific stylesheet.
3. Bands.scss - Banded page stylesheet.</p>

<h2 id="grunt-modules">Grunt Modules</h2>

<p><code>Grunt</code> Has been extremely helpful throughout the build process. Some of the modules I&rsquo;ve included have been:</p>

<ul>
<li>Compass - Compass compiler for SASS/SCSS files</li>
<li>Concat - Concatenante JS files so we can breakdown individual functions, but compile it to one file for production</li>
<li>Copy - A simple copy function from various sources

<ul>
<li>Copies CFM files from <code>src</code> to <code>dist</code></li>
<li>Copies vendor files from <code>node_modules</code> to <code>dist</code> (single files necessary for deployment)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>ImageMin - Processes images and reduces their file sizes without compramising quality.

<ul>
<li>Currently processes svg/png/gif/jpg</li>
<li>Copies files from <code>src</code> to <code>dist</code>; does not overwrite original files</li>
</ul></li>
<li>JSHint - Lints JS and shows where errors are in the console on <code>compile</code>

<ul>
<li>JSHint-Stylish - Gives terminal a bit more style when looking at the JS errors in CLI.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Uglify - Minifies JS. No need to run it through <code>compass</code>, as it can minify on compile</li>
<li>Watch - Allows for <code>grunt watch</code> which will watch files for changes to compile the necessary files automatically</li>
<li>PostCSS - Allows for CSS Post processors. Currently using:

<ul>
<li>Autoprefix - Pushes autoprefixes for CSS3 attributes based on <a href="http://caniuse.com" target="_blank">CanIUse.com</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Load-Grunt-Tasks - Loads the necessary grunt modules in one go, instead of loading things in individual calls</li>
<li>Time-Grunt - Breaks down execution time by task</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information visit <a href="http://gruntjs.com" target="_blank">GruntJS.com</a>.</p>

<h2 id="git">Git</h2>

<p>This repo is stored in a private Bitbucket repository under the Xavier University Account. Contributions need to be made through the Bitbucket repository. Files will not be available through any other means.</p>

<p>To contribute, you will need to <code>git pull</code> the master, <code>git push</code> to the <code>dev</code> branch and submit a pull request.</p>

<li>Reduction of email - could be great for Form Manager</li>
<li>Channel - Public</li>
<li>Groups - Private</li>
<li>Direct Message - between each individual</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Develop channel nomenclature</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>product-____ (wordpress/machforms) Issues or related<br /></li>
<li>project-____ (updates, management)</li>
<li>feed-____(social, hashtags, campaigns) RSS/Social anything posted gets archived here</li>
<li>help-____(desk, responses)</li>
<li>X-(music, spoiler-zone, sports-center, food) - non-work, informal</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>You can turn channels on and off</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Groups</li>
<li>Help desk team</li>
<li>special projects</li>
<li>management team</li>
<li>special interests groups</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Built in Functions</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>/feed -&gt; subscribe to new RSS or other feeds</li>
<li>/remind -&gt; reminders</li>
<li>code share/highlighting -&gt;</li>
<li>easy drag &amp; drop file sharing -&gt;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Integration</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>incoming web hooks - JSON arrays etc

<ul>
<li>post things to slack from PM tool</li>
</ul></li>
<li>IFTTT

<ul>
<li>allows to do one integration with a lot of different integrations (twitter/etc)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Giphy</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Slack Apps</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Mobile/Desktop/Browser</li>
<li>Vanderbilt has been on a free account for 2 years and have been able to integrate everything they need.</li>
<li>85% discount for Higher Education (accredited)</li>
<li>Standard: 12/user/year</li>
<li>Plus: 27/user/year</li>
</ul>

<p>10 integrations, but Vandy only uses 5. Archives are limited for 10,000 messages.</p>

<h2 id="uad7-accessibility">UAD7 - Accessibility</h2>

<ul>
<li>nomouse.org (no mouse challenge)</li>
<li>Try looking at your website without a mouse. Using keyboard only, Doesn’t need an assistive device</li>
<li>First thing to do is to look for ARIA landmarks</li>
<li>ARIA allows you to provide markup that sets role, stakes and properties of the User Interface elements</li>
<li>Low hanging fruit is to set landmark roles</li>
<li>Use JAWS as screen reader.</li>
<li>DIVS ARE NOT FOCUSABLE - not accessible via tab-index</li>
<li>Same with progress indicators (empty lists have no semantics)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Most carousels today are inaccessible</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Movement can be distracting, stop auto start carousels</li>
<li>For previous/next, use a button tag.</li>
<li>Use buttons for slide indicators <code>&lt;SR-ONLY&gt;&quot;Go to slide&quot;&lt;/SR-ONLY&gt;</code></li>
<li>Add aria-live to each slide. <code>&lt;role=&quot;alert&quot;&gt;</code> polite, assertive &gt; importance to announcing an item for the screen reader. Such as when the contents are exposed, announce it now.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Modal Windows:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><code>&lt;main content&gt;</code> needs to be marked aria-hidden=&ldquo;true&rdquo; when modal is in the foreground. BG is hidden when modal opens</li>
<li><code>&lt;modal mask&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;modal content&gt;</code> Cannot be inside of the main content!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Other area features for modal</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><code>role=&quot;dialog&quot; aria-labelledby</code> identified by the Title of the window</li>
<li><code>&lt;button aria-label=&quot;close dialog&quot;&gt;</code></li>
<li>Use H1 in modal Dialogs, because it’s the only content on the page for the screen reader.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Manage keystrokes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>When the window opens, place focus on the first focusable element</li>
<li>Trap tab key so it cycles through focusable elements in the modal only</li>
<li>Escape should close the window</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Dropdown Menus</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><code>role=&quot;menubar&quot;</code> for entire menu bar</li>
<li><code>role=&quot;menu&quot;</code> for content</li>
<li><code>role=&quot;menu</code> for sub menus</li>
<li><code>role=&quot;item&quot;</code> for each individual menu</li>
<li><code>aria-expanded=&quot;false&quot;</code></li>
<li><code>aria-popup=&quot;true&quot;</code></li>
<li><code>aria-controls</code> assign that it establishes a relationship with the sub content</li>
</ul>

<p>MENU is an application menu - providing a function, not a link to another page</p>

<p>Make it a NAV</p>

<p><strong>Action Items:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>no mouse challenge (nomouse.org)</li>
<li>Never stop learning</li>
<li>Always ask &ldquo;is this accessible&rdquo;</li>
<li>Only choose accessible tools and widgets</li>
<li>If it’s not, fix it! Contribute to a better world.</li>
</ul>

<p>#DPA9 - Building better Workflows</p>

<ul>
<li>Alabama Library has 3 dev 4 web librarians</li>
<li>Wide range of backgrounds</li>
<li>Optimal Dev Flow:

<ul>
<li>Sustainable</li>
<li>Automated</li>
<li>Configurable</li>
<li>Gentle Learning Curve</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Working on Your own - Manual source management</li>
<li>Great on your own. Straight forward</li>
<li>Until you start to work on your own</li>
<li>Working in a team - Manual source management</li>
<li>YOU Open and edit, upload to server</li>
<li>TEAM -&gt; didn’t update file, overrides old changes with new changes</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The ritual</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Update from Server &gt; Edit &gt; Double check if file has been updated &gt; Upload</li>
<li>Solution: Version Control

<ul>
<li>Sources is a versioned repo</li>
<li>Merge or preserve changes</li>
<li>Tracks changes</li>
<li>Revert or rollback</li>
<li>User permissions</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Versioning Systems</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Merge Changes only!</li>
<li>Commits YOU made</li>
<li>Commits from other dev</li>
<li>Merges changes to repo for you</li>
<li>Track Changes Easily</li>
<li>See EXACTLY what was changed</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Distributed Repos</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Server have team, need to be able to log onto the team</li>
<li>Distributed: Each teammate has a local repo to edit</li>
<li>Flexible Repo Structure</li>
<li>Some have required folders where you put certain items in a repo; can be convoluted</li>
<li>Flexible structure that is appropriate for the project (dist/src/etc)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Landed on Git</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Met our needs:

<ul>
<li>Distributed</li>
<li>Common</li>
<li>Flexible repo</li>
<li>Content VCS - only content stored</li>
<li>SUSE Enterprise supported it</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Branching Models

<ul>
<li>Each clone is a branch. Each clone can have branches in it</li>
<li>Complicated branching can seem convoluted and intimidating didn’t want that</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Simple Model

<ul>
<li>Central origin on the server</li>
<li>Distributed Clones (clone server repo - MAIN, default branch)</li>
<li>Single Origin</li>
<li>Single Branch</li>
<li>Distributed clones</li>
<li>Origin -&gt; Your branch -&gt; Merge to it</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Living on the server

<ul>
<li>Git server [git://]</li>
<li>Security and authentication</li>
<li>user permissions</li>
<li>(ugh, I have to learn more stuff)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Github</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Organization Account

<ul>
<li>Contributors</li>
<li>Teams</li>
<li>Permissions</li>
<li>Admins</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Many useful features

<ul>
<li>Repo and commit browsing</li>
<li>Statistics</li>
<li>Wiki</li>
<li>Bug reporting</li>
<li>much more</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What about dependencies</strong></p>

<p>Separate from your repos, but integral to development</p>

<ul>
<li>Manual management in a team

<ul>
<li>Start project, two weeks later someone else is in the project. Clones central repo</li>
<li>jQuery is being used, but manually managed. Downloads jQuery and ignored in the repo</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bower - Uses nodeJS - Automate Dependency Managemnt

<ul>
<li>bower install angular</li>
<li>bower install jquery/jquery</li>
<li>bower install <a href="https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome.git" target="_blank">https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome.git</a></li>
<li>Git endpoint</li>
<li>URL</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Project Configuration</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Single command install</li>
<li>Specify Versions</li>
<li>Use public and private servers</li>
<li>Clone the repo and type in bower install. by setting everything up with bower install and the JSON configuration file</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Getting Organized</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Catch All</p>

<ul>
<li>inconvenient</li>
<li>search to find feature</li>
<li>some features go unnoticed</li>
<li>CATCHALL (do not use)</li>
<li>index.html</li>
<li>scripts.js</li>
<li>styles.css</li>
<li>utilities.js</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Modularization</p>

<ul>
<li>Separation of concerns</li>
<li>each unique feature is packaged separately in unique folder/file</li>
<li>features easier to find</li>
<li>Modules (better structure)</li>
<li>common

<ul>
<li>carousel</li>
<li>filters</li>
<li>navbar</li>
</ul></li>
<li>forms

<ul>
<li>forms.css</li>
<li>forms.js</li>
</ul></li>
<li>menu

<ul>
<li>menu.css</li>
<li>menu.js</li>
</ul></li>
<li>news-feed

<ul>
<li>news-feed.css</li>
<li>news-feed.js</li>
</ul></li>
<li>global.css</li>
<li>index.html</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How do we put it all together?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Grunt - nodeJS Javascript Task Runner

<ul>
<li>Repetetive redundant tasks</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Concatenate

<ul>
<li>Combines scripts into dist folder</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Uglify

<ul>
<li>Simplifies your functions</li>
<li>makes code harder to read in distributed form</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Minify

<ul>
<li>Removes whitespace for you</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Configure Tasks

<ul>
<li>Setup the configuration to run the tasks, points it to the file and give it the options</li>
<li>Dev Task concats</li>
<li>Live task runs dev tasks and goes further (grunt dev; grunt live)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Much Much more

<ul>
<li>Clean</li>
<li>Copy</li>
<li>Release version</li>
<li>Shell commands</li>
<li>Auto-prefix</li>
<li>Run other NodeJS tools</li>
<li>Site builders (documentation)</li>
<li>KSS</li>
<li>jsDoc</li>
<li>Lint</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>JS</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Compile</li>
<li>LESS</li>
<li>SASS</li>
<li>Coffee</li>
<li>Compress</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Images</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Deploy</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Manual Dev to Live flow

<ul>
<li>Manually copy files from dev to live</li>
<li>Tempting to just edit live</li>
<li>Messier dev gets, the less appealing it is to work from</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Git Hooks and Live/Dev forks through GitHub

<ul>
<li>Fire on events done to a repo</li>
<li>Configure to fire when a repo is updated</li>
<li>Easy to update the repo and it updates live, which updates servers</li>
<li>Live/Dev repos</li>
<li>Machine User owns Live Repo</li>
<li>Dev repo forks Live</li>
<li>Git Hook Deployment</li>
<li>Update github = update server</li>
<li>&ldquo;Gatekeepers&rdquo; control flow to live</li>
<li>Contributors can make &ldquo;pull request&rdquo; when ready to go live</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Branch Model</strong></p>

<p>Live &gt; Dev &gt; Local Dev (clone)</p>

<p><strong>Git Workflow</strong></p>

<p>Dev Clone &gt; Push to Dev repo (no conflict, updates dev) &gt; Pull request submits to live. Notify gatekeeper to live repo. Wants to pull changes into live. Approved, pulled and merged into live and updates the live server.</p>

<p>No one touches the code on the live servers.</p>

<p><strong>All Together</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Version source</li>
<li>Automated

<ul>
<li>dependency management</li>
<li>source tasks/builds</li>
<li>deployment</li>
</ul></li>

<h2 id="build-a-calendar-that-doesn-t-suck-livewhale-calendar">Build a calendar that doesn&rsquo;t suck - LiveWhale Calendar</h2>

<p><strong>Why calendars are what they are:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Most calendars on the web are byproducts of EMS, Room reservation systems and resource scheduling systems.</li>
<li>For some, these are products are an afterthought</li>
<li>Room reservation is like meth (if you never have it, it&rsquo;s fine;</li>
<li>People think of events as a marketing item</li>
<li>Every audience depends on events, but everyone&rsquo;s needs are different</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Ideas and Suggestions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Tell everyone who will listen that events are crucially important part of marketing

<ul>
<li>Three most overlooked opportunities</li>
<li>What do students do on the weekends</li>
<li>Is it boring to live in ___ (Terre Haute)</li>
<li>What is my alma mater doing with my money</li>
<li>These are questions that people ACTUALLY ask</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t go anywhere near a calendar solution that doesn&rsquo;t export data in open formats like RSS</li>
<li>A perfect calendar has to be all things to everyone, it can&rsquo;t be done</li>

<li><p>Calendar will disappoint someone; even if it doesn&rsquo;t suck</p></li>

<li><p>Some will love it; something that addresses their needs!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Go out and &ldquo;Not suck&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="the-scroll-getscrolled-hamilton-edu-thescroll-hamilton-college">THE SCROLL #getscrolled - hamilton.edu/thescroll - Hamilton College</h2>

<p>All the different online media/social accounts/email etc. At the institutional level. SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS</p>

<p>Not a lot of give and take with the audience</p>

<p>Use <em>found</em> content - It&rsquo;s on social media, but not on our site…how do we get it there?</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s the problem?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Who&rsquo;s the audience? - specific things at specific times/ you DO have a specific audience</li>
<li>Trying to communicate?</li>
<li>Success looks like?</li>
<li>Current Preferences? How do they WANT to engage with us</li>
<li>Infuence mentions and engagement - Brand inconsistencies; Not artsy etc. etc.</li>
<li>Flip the way people see you by using Social Media</li>
<li>FB/TW/Instagram - were the most used</li>
<li>FB is pages/groups/events (brand, authentic in what&rsquo;s shared with us)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>TEACH strategy</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>This is how we communicate from here on out - everyone goes into one pot</li>
<li>Support their projects - It&rsquo;s &ldquo;our&rdquo; project, it&rsquo;s EVERYONE&rsquo;s responsibility to keep up with it</li>
<li>Top down/Bottom Up</li>
<li>Time Commitments

<ul>
<li>Who has control? Depends on the place</li>
<li>Technical issues</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>BRANDING focus - campaign is not marketing…it&rsquo;s capital campaigns in Higher Ed</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>No one voice outshining</li>
<li>Watch the &lsquo;one offs&rsquo;</li>
<li>Everything supports larger brand ira</li>
<li>Brand business and outcome</li>
<li>The scroll pulls mentions - hash tags and a variety of other accounts</li>
<li>No gimmicks</li>
<li>Low barrier to entry</li>
<li>The good and the Bad - Not too much of a problem anymore because it&rsquo;s REAL</li>
<li>Timeliness is crucial</li>
<li>They do NOT autopost or schedule - Why not at all? Doing it responsibly?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Every event has a Hashtag - it goes on EVERYTHING print email everything</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>1 year ahead of time</li>
<li>Coordinating conversations with various hashtags - They are useful everywhere now</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Social media directory - We need to build this&hellip;NOW</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The Scroll</li>
<li>My Hamilton</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>ASK for audience ideas</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Continue education</li>
<li>Policy vs Guidelines - If you do it, here&rsquo;s how you are expected to behave

<ul>
<li>Before you are our community member, this is how you do it</li>
<li>Use social and Here&rsquo;s how - not Come to us to do social</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Comment and content guidelines - Basic premise, if you don&rsquo;t say it to your mom; don&rsquo;t say it</p>

<p><strong>Measurement: Defining Goals</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>NOPE Vanity metrics (likes/followers)</li>
<li>Positive Sentiment</li>
<li>&ldquo;The scroll&rdquo; itself is probably the 10th most trafficked page.</li>
</ul>

<p>EVERYTHING is hand-picked; nothing is added via aggregator</p>

</ul>

<p>Revision Control Systems</p>

<ul>
<li>Track changes</li>
<li>Better for source code</li>
</ul>

<p>Why Choose Git?</p>

<ul>
<li>Open Source and free</li>
<li>Distributed gives you autonomy</li>
<li>Easy branching for experimenting</li>
<li>The Delta It&rsquo;s Efficient</li>
<li>Revisions, not versions</li>

<ul>
<li>1st change: git init</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Each change links to previous</li>
<li>The 3 Areas</li>
<li>Working Copy

<ul>
<li>Anytime I change or add to a repo</li>
<li>Select things from the working copy and go to staging; then submit to the repo</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Staging Index</li>
<li>Repo</li>
</ul>

<p>Analogy - Packing a suitcase</p>

<ul>
<li>Take shirts out of closet, lay on bed - working copy</li>
<li>Pick shirts from - From working put in pile ready to fold - staging area</li>

<li><p>Fold it then &ldquo;commit&rdquo; to the suitcase - repo</p></li>

<li><p>Choose pants from closet</p></li>

<li><p>Choose from Pile and Fold</p></li>

<li><p>Folded pants go into suitcase - repo &amp; commit</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Commands</p>

<ul>
<li>Take socks out of the drawer</li>
<li>Command: none

<ul>
<li>Last time I looked, there were no socks; they were in the drawer</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Get socks; roll them up

<ul>
<li>Command: git add

<ul>
<li>Moves changes to stage from working copy</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Command git commit

<li>Can commit one or multiple changes</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Step 4: Put unused clothes away</li>
<li>Command: git checkout

<ul>
<li>Erases changes from the working copy</li>
<li>A good way to get out of a bad situation</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Commit 1: Shirts</p>

<p>Commit 2: Shirts Pants</p>

<p>Commit 3: Shirts Pants Socks</p>

<p>Commits are sequential</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Head&rdquo; - Detached Head</p>

<ul>
<li>Points at the most recent commit for the branch you are on</li>
<li>The head will pick up where you left off (like a cassette or video tape)</li>
</ul>

<p>Branches</p>

<ul>
<li>Use Git within what you are already doing

<ul>
<li>Command: git branch <name></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Clones your repo up until the most recent</li>
<li>OR you can rewind it and clone from previous state</li>
<li>New working copy and staging index

<ul>
<li>clean working copy</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Git Flow - a branching model</li>
<li>Switching Branches

<ul>
<li>git checkout <name></li>
<li>Quickly swap to different branch</li>
<li>Changes what&rsquo;s in your editor</li>
<li>Changes what&rsquo;s in the browser</li>
</ul></li>
<li>An Example: Trip to Jamaica</li>

<li>Merging changes

<ul>
<li>git merge</li>
<li>Take changes and merge them into the Master Branch</li>
<li>ALL items can come into both branches; or be selective</li>

<h2 id="digital-asset-management">Digital Asset Management</h2>

<p>Who should be included using the system?</p>

<p>How do you know what assets you have and what you go in</p>

<p>Practical Tips for IA with RWD:</p>

<ul>
<li>Kill the page…</li>
<li>IA / Discovery phase</li>
<li>Planning for function design and content while disregarding ALL assumptions about the device</li>
<li>Content Modeling

<ul>
<li>Content types separate from design - NOTHING to do with design</li>
<li>What it is, what it says, and what attributes are assigned</li>
<li>Prepared for future friendly world</li>
<li>Device and platform agnostic

<ul>
<li>Consider size range of screens</li>
<li>Smart Watches/Car/Big screen/Smart TV/Small screens/Digital Signage</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The accordion factor

<ul>
<li>Meaningful messages that can be used in our world</li>
<li>computers integrate more with humans</li>
</ul></li>
<li>77% of MOBILE searches take place at home or work, 17% on the-go according to Google.</li>
<li>Low-income/HS educated are more likely to be mobile-only</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How do we plan?

<ul>
<li>Kill the Page.</li>
<li>Blobs - Free for all WYSIWYG

<ul>
<li>Hand-me-down from print era; Insert (page) content here</li>
<li>No context when removed from form</li>
<li>&ldquo;But I pasted a table from Word&rdquo;</li>
<li>A blob is limiting and won&rsquo;t survive without a page!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Chunk - content removed, it still makes sense

<ul>
<li>Structured content with meta-data to give context</li>
<li>Removed from form, and still make sense (chunk and falfor, never ending story!)</li>
<li>Future friendly content = the never ending story</li>
<li>HOW do we create it?

<ul>
<li>structured content</li>
<li>semantic metadata</li>
<li>content packages</li>
<li>new user experience for content editors</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Chunk content plan

<ul>
<li>Content matrix that separates out each piece of content type = content modeling</li>
<li>includes recommendations, attributes and suggestions</li>
<li>removes all notion of (page) location</li>
<li>Client uses as a worksheet to gather content regardless of where it goes</li>
<li>Enables us to implement the COPE method (create once publish everywhere)

<ul>
<li>Client never</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Excel Breakdown

<ul>
<li>General Content Needs - Questions that needs to get answered

<ul>
<li>What is ____</li>
<li>History of ____</li>
<li>About the space</li>
<li>Who can use it</li>
<li>How can a new person get involved</li>
<li>Why should someone get involved (prospective)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Deliverables: client returns content entered into worksheet - separated from form

<ul>
<li>Focus is shifted to content alone!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This results in a path for structured content</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The How</li>
</ul>

<p>Phases:</p>

<ul>
<li>Discovery

<ul>
<li>IA Questionnaire (who, what, when, why, wtf is the point!)</li>
<li>Analytics and peer site review</li>
<li>Deliverables: 10 Content priorities, &ldquo;our&rdquo; perspective - easier to edit than work together&hellip;

<ul>
<li>what is the most important piece to communicate?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sitemap/Annotated Sitemap

<ul>
<li>With a non device specific approach. Streamlined navigation. No 3rd level navigation if we can help it</li>
<li>Client deliverables:

<ul>
<li>PDF of proposed navigation structure</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Internal Deliverable:

<ul>
<li>Annotated sitemap: excel document that lists my vision for what should go on each page. Column for functional requirements and for graphic needs. Keeping mobile in mind.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Chunk content plan

<ul>
<li>Follow the chunk life cycle for { Project Team Title } and { Fun Fact } in the following</li>
<li>Semantic Metadata - entity relationship diagram for project teams</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Wireframe/IA

<ul>
<li>Mobile first - sit with iPhone in hand &ldquo;how do I want to do this&rdquo;</li>
<li>Project Team page first</li>
<li>Using UX Pin</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Design

<ul>
<li>Styling Chunks</li>
<li>Design the nag</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Dev - gives chunk content plan life!

<ul>
<li>Dev team took chunk plan and created a new type of field</li>
<li>Content packaages…tagging things..</li>
<li>Modules/Macros for inserting youtube links. Setup the MAX width/height to be specific</li>
<li>Should all chunks be viewable on mobile: ABSOLUTELY</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Training/Content Entry</li>

<p>Using Drupal (7)</p>

<p>February 2013 - First site redesign in 10+ years</p>

<p>Groups were formed (volunteers) and different teams</p>

<ul>
<li>Research &amp; more…</li>
</ul>

<p>The people part: Developing usable co-workers, committees, bosses, stakeholders</p>

<ul>
<li>We have to talk - are they ready to hear bad or not awesome news?</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t oversell - small quick tests can be a hard sell in academics</li>
<li>Data and video are hard to ignore</li>
<li>2-ish years of planning</li>
</ul>

<p>Look at the things that DON&rsquo;t work - even stuff that you&rsquo;ve built.</p>

<p>small groups aren&rsquo;t effective; but 8 would be effective (quick iterative testing)</p>

<ul>
<li>Best we can know at this point in time</li>
</ul>

<p>ARGUE LESS. TEST MORE.</p>

<ul>
<li>we can argue over what a link is, but let&rsquo;s test it and have data tomorrow to move forward</li>
<li>Instead of us talking; let&rsquo;s do a test and get information</li>
<li>Know what you can know when you can know it

<ul>
<li>Know everything you can BEFORE the site goes live. Test WHILE you IA, design, wireframe etc</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Redesign Objectives

<ul>
<li>Get applicants</li>
<li>Outward focused</li>

<li>What&rsquo;s your impression of the site based on this page? watch users complete specific tasks</li>
<li>Useful to confirm suspicions</li>
<li>Small sample: 5-8 users at a time</li>
</ul>

<p>Old site, first impressions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What&rsquo;s your initial impression

<ul>
<li>Not professional…amateur</li>
<li>Not much on the page; not very prestigious. Two fonts, two colors that&rsquo;s it. Not big at all. Rolling pictures of students being happy. Seems like there isn&rsquo;t much here</li>
<li>Unexpected results:

<li>Some kind of cat on the left…</li>

<ul>
<li>Simple website, separation of things, you have to read; no intuitive way of seeing what&rsquo;s what.  No pictures. All words.</li>
<li>Too many options within a list. Programs and admissions should be highlighted.</li>

<p>Overall results:</p>

<ul>
<li>New site efficiently bounced them to the appropriate area; but still went to the old places</li>
</ul>

<p>Software:</p>

<ul>
<li>Usertesting.com - Full site with video and people thinking out loud; They have the test panel; Rate experience 1-10</li>
<li>Usabilla - Click tracking on Flat Files; You provide the people (5-10 each test)</li>
<li>Usabilitest - Not recommended; Though card sorting</li>
<li>Loop11 - Full site; task based tracking</li>
</ul>

<p>NO MOBILE USER TESTING….pushed off to the side because of timing; moving too fast, didn&rsquo;t want to do.</p>

            <description>The 2013-2014 season at Rose-Hulman ended better than I ever could have imagined. After breaking more than 20 records in the 2012-2013 season, I never would have imagined breaking another 13. We sent two to the NCAA Division III National Championships.

<p>The 2013-2014 season at Rose-Hulman ended better than I ever could have imagined. After breaking more than 20 records in the <a href="/posts/2013/05/season-recap-2012-13/" title="2011-2012 Season Recap">2012-2013 season</a>,
I never would have imagined breaking another 13. We sent two to the NCAA Division III National Championships.</p>

<p>Both swam well and <a href="https://rosehulman.prestosports.com/sports/swimdive/2013-14/releases/20140605ra7s23" target="_blank">earned All-American status</a> by finishing in the top 8.</p>

<h2 id="personal-challenges">Personal Challenges</h2>

<p>This season was easier than last year.</p>

<p>From my point of view, I had a very successful season. I worked to understand the ideology behind the training structure,
I trained starts and turns exclusively toward the end of the season and even had a stroke of genius, helping a freshman finish in the top 8 in a new event after observing his awesome back start.</p>

<p>Aside from that, I found a new coach to mentor. I&#8217;m extremely flattered that he sees me as his mentor, and I hope he continues to work in the swimming community.</p>

<h2 id="2013-2014-season-results">2013-2014 Season Results</h2>

<ul>
<li>2 All-Americans (first since 2003; first female in program, second in school history)</li>
<li>2 National Swimmers of the Week</li>
<li>Men&#8217;s 2nd place at CCIW, program best (until 2014, when they won it all.)</li>
<li>13 school records</li>
<li>10 top-two finishers</li>
<li>10 all-conference performances</li>

            <description>As many of you know, my time at Rose-Hulman was always limited. Sarah and I knew that match day would come and we would inevitably be told where we were going to live, not by our hearts, but by a computer system.
On Friday, March 21 we opened a letter, read the words and to saw we will be starting a new life in Northern Kentucky.
When I started coaching, I never envisioned leaving a program would be as hard as it is today.</description>

<p>On Friday, March 21 we opened a letter, read the words and to saw we will be starting a new life in Northern Kentucky.</p>

<p>When I started coaching, I never envisioned leaving a program would be as hard as it is today. I’ve had the opportunity to coach a variety of swimmers ranging from 6-22. From people just happy to learn the strokes, to (now) NCAA All-Americans. Believe me when I say it’s just as hard to leave this team as it was a 6-year-old that held on to my leg at a swim meet.</p>

<p>I want to thank you for your patience and understanding in year one as I was trying to find my voice and for your attention as we all “adjusted” in year two.</p>

<p>I wish you all nothing but the best and hope to see as many as I can before I leave. Currently, there is no timeline when I will leave.</p>

<p>If anyone wants to stay in contact you can always find me on twitter.</p>

<p>Thank you and best of luck in everything you do.</p>

<p><strong>Edit: </strong>As of May 30, 2014 I will no longer be working for Rose-Hulman.</p>

No matter the outcome, these situations strengthen connections and can often help when reaching your full potential.</p>

<p><strong>Find what you love.</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve come up with some fairly off-the-wall ideas from paintball, laser tag to a web design/development firm. All of them have come crashing down with love and support of our families. They knew we wouldn&#8217;t succeed, because we were capable of so much more and our hearts weren&#8217;t in it.</p>

<p>I recently talked with a Gen X’er about how Millennial&#8217;s (such as myself) often job hop. My question, why is this a bad thing? Sometimes you need to job hop! It’s the easiest way to stop doing something you do not enjoy.</p>

<p>Want to reach your full potential? Know what you do not want to do and what you are not capable of doing. In Jay Baer&#8217;s terms, “stop doing what you are not uniquely qualified to do.”</p>

<p><strong>Succeed, no matter what!</strong></p>

<p>Success is hard to come by, expect and embrace failure. Reaching your full potential is lined with success, but it will also be entangled by failure. Success is not determined by failure, but your reaction.</p>

<p>Failure is not intertwined with “I give up.” Instead, you should react with “okay, this method does not work. How can I improve it?” Your drive and determination contribute to your success.</p>

<p><strong>Reaching your full potential.</strong></p>

<p>In an earlier post, <a href="/posts/2013/01/reaffirming-a-coaching-career-choice">Reaffirming a Coaching Career</a>, a former swimmer of mine shared why my belief in him proved beneficial. Find someone who inspires you to do great things.</p>

<p>Having someone believe and share in your success, is a great inspirational tool.</p>

<p>Everyone takes their eyes off the goal. Everyone. Who remembers Michael Phelps&#8217; incident after the 2008 Olympics? What about Ryan Lochte, did you even know he was debating skipping the 2016 Olympics, but recently <a href="http://www.indystar.com/article/20130624/SPORTS/306240086/USA-Swimming-nationals-Ryan-Lochte-decides-he-s-serious-about-2016-Rio-Olympics" target="_blank">changed his mind</a>?</p>

<p>See, even gold medal athletes get distracted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Obstacles are what you see when you take your eyes off the goal.
  - Vince Lombardi</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="staying-motivated">Staying Motivated</h2>

<p>There are thousands of articles on how to stay motivated. The best way to stay motivated is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Have someone push you</li>
<li>Set goals</li>
<li>Have FUN</li>
</ol>

<p>Most athletes take the fun out of working out. Yes, it&#8217;s a workout. No it&#8217;s not always fun. How many people are like me and workout alone? Are you more motivated to workout the next time? Probably not. I&#8217;m not.</p>

<p>Having fun while working out OR having fun with your workout group is an easy way to stay motivated.</p>

<h2 id="setting-goals">Setting Goals</h2>

<p>How great of a feeling is it to cross something off your &#8220;to-do list&#8221;? Create one with your workout! Keep yourself motivated by setting realistic and attainable workout goals. In the Patriot Mel Gipson tell&#8217;s his son &#8220;aim small, miss small.&#8221; While it&#8217;s slightly out of context, it still applies.</p>

<p>Set small attainable goals and keep yourself and others excited about what&#8217;s next!</p>

<h2 id="make-workouts-fun">Make Workouts Fun!</h2>

<p>For me, I work harder on challenging sets. Not just because they are challenging, but because they are fun. Coaches can motivate their athletes by creating challenging sets that make an athlete think. Individuals should create challenging and fun workout environments by creating games, goals and competitions between workout partners.</p>

<p>Some of the best workouts I ever got as an athlete were on game days. From water polo to Ultimate Frisbee (or Ultimate Med-Ball for those up to a true challenge) choose a game where you are challenged mentally and physically.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-you">What about you?</h2>

<p>How do you stay motivated during your workouts? Or, how do you keep your athletes motivated? Share your opinion in the comments below.</p>

            <title>Updated: Umbraco Page Titles</title>

            <description>Since creating the first rendition of the Structured Page Titles for Umbraco, I decided it would be worthwhile to revisit and clean up the size of the file and make it much more readable. Umbraco makes it easy to define page titles, but this script helps reduce the repetitive nature of titles in larger sites.
To use this code you will need to create a shortPageTitle and pageTitle in your document type(s).</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[

<p>Since creating the first rendition of the <a href="/posts/2013/01/structured-umbraco-page-titles/">Structured Page Titles for Umbraco</a>, I decided it would be worthwhile to revisit
and clean up the size of the file and make it much more readable. Umbraco makes it easy to define page titles, but this script helps reduce the repetitive nature of titles in larger sites.</p>

<p>To use this code you will need to create a shortPageTitle and pageTitle in your document type(s). Skip this step or change&nbsp;the script to work in your install.</p>

<p>First off, we need to declare our global variables. This pulls in the current page&#8217;s level as well as setting up the <code>current</code> variable for use later on.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/mcmullengreg/27785029d3f7250388a2.js?file=globalVars.cshtml"></script>

<p>Next we break into the loop to filter through all the pages. This is also where we start to breakdown the conditional statements to display what we want, when we want it.</p>

<p>We open the loop using the current pageLevel, decreasing by 1 until we reach 1. We want to include 1 so we grab the Homepage&#8217;s title as well.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/mcmullengreg/27785029d3f7250388a2.js?file=loop.cshtml"></script>

<p>Within the loop, we include <code>divider</code>, to select the&nbsp;separator we want between the page names. For mine, I used <code>|</code> and <code>-</code>. Other than that, I put &#8220;&#8221; at the end to make sure we have nothing after the site title,
this was a huge point of frustration and elation once I figured it out.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/mcmullengreg/27785029d3f7250388a2.js?file=divider.cshtml"></script>

<p>After defining divider&nbsp;you can form the title tags. As you can see, this code has a lot going on. For our site, we have a dedicated Homepage title that is longer than we want for child pages. We used shortPageTitle&nbsp;on the homepage node and access it by checking if shortPageTitle exists AND if we are NOT on the homepage. Otherwise, it displays the shortPageTitle &amp; Divider, or the Page title (if it has a value) or the Page Name if everything else is blank.</p>

            <description>With my first collegiate season under my belt, I am definitely looking forward to my second year (and more, if possible).
We wrapped up the season with 20 individual records (more with diving) and had two compete at the NCAA Division III National Championships.
Challenges Being a first-year (first-time collegiate) coach was intimidating. While I felt the need to approach the athletes different, I didn&amp;#8217;t. They were responsive to my critiques and criticisms, inviting the views from a coach they didn&amp;#8217;t know that well.</description>

<p>With my first collegiate season under my belt, I am definitely looking forward to my second year (and more, if possible).</p>

<p>We wrapped up the season with 20 individual records (more with diving) and had two compete at the NCAA Division III National Championships.</p>

<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>

<p>Being a first-year (first-time collegiate) coach was intimidating. While I felt the need to approach the athletes different, I didn&#8217;t. They were responsive to my critiques and criticisms, inviting the views from a coach they didn&#8217;t know that well.</p>

<p>As the year progressed, I got worn down and contemplated quitting. Sarah kept me focused by reminding me of the previous two years and how excited I was to see the hard work pay off.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<ul>
<li>Two National Qualifiers</li>
<li>20 School Records</li>
<li>13 Provisional Qualification times</li>
<li>14 All-Conference Awards</li>
<li>Five event victories</li>
</ul>

<p>Outside of the pool, our teams earned an All-Academic selection.</p>

<h2 id="goals-for-next-year">Goals for Next Year</h2>

<p>I need to continue to push my boundaries and get more involved in finding out &#8220;what works&#8221; and &#8220;why.&#8221; This can only help me grow as a coach and an ambassador for our sport.</p>

            <description>Recently, I received a series of text messages from a former swimmer. I only coached this athlete for two high school seasons and not only did he have an impact on my life, but these messages clearly showed that I had an impact on his as well.
 Hey Coach Greg! I just wanted to shoot you a quick text here. I just wanted to let you know how grateful I was to have had you as my head coach senior year.</description>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey Coach Greg! I just wanted to shoot you a quick text here. I just wanted to let you know how grateful I was to have had you as my head coach senior year. I know this might be a little late, but my family and I were discussing swim season and I was describing my senior season to them and out of all the sports and coaches I have had you were the most inspiring to me. You inspired a goof of a kid with some talent to put his mind and will to a sport and team and I will always appreciate that. You taught me valuable life lessons that I will carry for the rest of my life…senior year was such a blast and seeing you behind us not only as a coach but as friends too meant a lot to me. Seeing you get emotional at conference truly I feel was the moment that defined you as a coach. Emotional, yet reserved and fully supportive of everybody on the team. Not just varsity, but also JV. Even if you may have some things you would&#8217;ve changed or done differently if you had a second chance, just know that I wouldn&#8217;t have changed a single thing. That season, that team was the best of my high school career. You believed in me when other coaches didn&#8217;t, and sometimes that&#8217;s all someone really needs is someones belief in them. The only thing I might have changed is to have you as my coach for my whole high school career (haha). I just thought I should give a long deserved thanks from me to you Coach Greg. I hope that you have luck in coaching because you&#8217;re one damn good coach.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Comments like this help reaffirm a coaching career choice. Because of these athletes I will always make the time and invest in their success.</p>

<p>Who have you heard from and what have they said to make what you do mean even more?</p>

            <description>Over the weekend, a friend asked me to do something I&amp;#8217;ve never done before. Photograph their wedding.
While I wasn&amp;#8217;t the official photographer, I was asked to take one of the last photos of the night. The one posted below. I have never done photos like this and was impressed with my results. I have done zero post work (yet) and am looking for tips/tricks/advice on post work and general thoughts of how it turned out.</description>

            <description>For the last three weeks, I&amp;#8217;ve been working towards finding my own way. The people at Rose-Hulman have made my transition extremely easy and incredibly fun.
I&amp;#8217;ve been introduced to a large group of people and have already been given a large project that will change the way this school looks at social media. I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to getting it off the ground.
This new position I&amp;#8217;m in has been a very large change compared to where I was previously, they are embracing technology and putting the latest and greatest tools in front of me.</description>

<p>I am so grateful for my past experiences, but I am looking forward to all of the new challenges that lie ahead of me.</p>

            <description>The other day, I finally decided to weigh myself. I weighed in at 194.4lbs. New goal, weigh in the 180&amp;#8217;s before August 11.
The immediate question on my mind is not, &amp;#8220;why don&amp;#8217;t I take better care of myself.&amp;#8221; Rather it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;why is it coaches seem to take better care of their athletes than themselves.&amp;#8221; Maybe I&amp;#8217;m wrong, but I would love for others to chime in.
So I want to reach out to all gathering ideas on the subject and how we can change our actions to better portray the things we teach.</description>

            <description>People have asked me, why do you work so much? I didn&amp;#8217;t really understand what they meant until this last year. Throughout the year, I work 3 different jobs which range, at times, from 5:30am until 8:00pm.
Why do you work so much? I don&amp;#8217;t do it for the pay, I don&amp;#8217;t do it for the recognition. I do it because I want to pay off my bills. I&amp;#8217;ve worked the same base full-time job for nearly 3 years, and honestly it&amp;#8217;s helped me pay off my debt better than I thought it would.</description>

<p>People have asked me, why do you work so much? I didn&#8217;t really understand what they meant until this last year. Throughout the year, I work 3 different jobs which range, at times, from 5:30am until 8:00pm.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-you-work-so-much">Why do you work so much?</h2>

<p>I don&#8217;t do it for the <em>pay</em>, I don&#8217;t do it for the recognition. I do it because I want to pay off my bills. I&#8217;ve worked the same base full-time job for nearly 3 years, and honestly it&#8217;s helped me pay off my debt better than I thought it would. I&#8217;ve had some excellent situations though that allowed me to pay off 2 student loans within a year of graduating.</p>

<p><strong>I&#8217;ve been blessed&#8230;</strong> Thus far, I&#8217;ve only had to pay one years worth of rent which means everything else goes towards my car, student loans and (wait for it&#8230;&#8230;.) SAVINGS (401k and IRA)! (<a href="http://twitter.com/petetheplanner" target="_blank">@PeteThePlanner</a> would be proud I&#8217;m sure)</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never been much of a &#8220;student&#8221; &#8211; honestly I didn&#8217;t graduate from Xavier University with a great overall GPA, but there was one class that forced me to wake up and realize what I need to do. That class was Finance.</p>

<p>So Prof. Sisak, thank you. I never had a professor ingrain something in my head so deeply.</p>

<p>At 25 years old, I have one student loan to pay off along with  $10k in a car loan left to pay. My goal is have no debt by the time Sarah finishes school and we buy our first home.</p>

            <description>It&amp;#8217;s simple, Coaches and athletes have to have goals. However, you have to make sure that the athletes and coaching staff buy into those goals and are all on the same page too. How do you do that? How does it work? What does it look like before/during/after? Well, this season was all about that.
This season was a different monster; it was something I wasn&amp;#8217;t quite ready for. I was responsible for practice development, discipline and general team maintenance.</description>

<p>It&#8217;s simple, Coaches and athletes have to have goals. However, you have to make sure that the athletes and coaching staff buy into those goals and are all on the same page too. How do you do that? How does it work? What does it look like before/during/after? Well, this season was all about that.</p>

<p>This season was a different monster; it was something I wasn&#8217;t quite ready for. I was responsible for practice development, discipline and general team maintenance. It was new and I was afraid of it, but I know that it helped me grow further than I thought possible in 5 months.</p>

<h2 id="meeting-challenges-with-open-arms">Meeting Challenges with Open Arms</h2>

<p>Ask anyone around me, I was nervous (looking back on it, I still am). However, I knew that with hard work, dedication, research and a little luck our season would be a success.</p>

<p>The very first challenge I had to overcome was the fear of practice development and drafting meet lineups. This wasn&#8217;t an easy task by any means. For me, practice development takes a very long time. I&#8217;ve taken some advice from Glenn Mills from GoSwim.TV and GoSwimTV.com in regards to &#8220;write practices you would want to swim&#8221; and integrated that into my practice writing. My goal was to create challenging sets mentally and physically &#8211; mix it up and make them <em>think</em> about what they were swimming, instead of just doing it.</p>

<h2 id="gaining-respect-and-faith-in-leadership">Gaining Respect and Faith in Leadership</h2>

<p>While I say that practice development was the biggest challenge, I also knew that gaining respect would be difficult. Luckily, I worked with most of these athletes in the previous year. Consistency in a coaching staff created a very solid foundation with the athletes in our program. (It also helps to come from the former head coaches &#8220;tree&#8221;)</p>

<p>For some, it took weeks to buy into the program direction. However by mid December, after the Marion County Championship Meet, it seemed like people had bought in. This was clear by the success we had at conference and sectionals, but we had some great times at a variety of other meets along the path.</p>

<p>Respect is earned and cannot be expected nor forced. It&#8217;s hard gaining respect and I believe that a person&#8217;s character can lead to the success or failure of gaining that respect.</p>

<h2 id="finally-8230">Finally&#8230;.</h2>

<p>The season ended with a bang. The girls finished strong. We had many athletes finish within the top 16 at sectionals and we ended up finishing 4th overall, what impressed me more was the poise at which they swam. We didn&#8217;t have nearly as much fear as we have in the past. The girls were confident and calm; they swam like it too.</p>

<p>The boys finished the season strong as well, including having at least one swimmer in every event. The meet started and finished the strongest, with our 200 medley and 400 free relay setting new school records.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m extremely proud I was a part of these teams and look forward to continuing my coaching career.</p>

            <description>I honestly can&amp;#8217;t remember the last time I actually wanted to make a New Year&amp;#8217;s resolution. However, I am wanting to better my life and others around me so here it is; making it 100% public for the first time.
First: Eat out less and stop buying microwaveable/prepackaged frozen foods.
Second: Work out more. (The typical New Year&amp;#8217;s Resolution, right?)
Third: Take care of myself and things I care about first and make more time for these things.</description>

<p><strong>First:</strong> Eat out less and stop buying microwaveable/prepackaged frozen foods.</p>

<p><strong>Second:</strong> Work out more. (The typical New Year&#8217;s Resolution, right?)</p>

<p><strong>Third:</strong> Take care of myself and things I care about first and make more time for these things.</p>

<p><strong>Fourth:</strong> Take more pictures! It&#8217;s something I enjoy, and I need to take advantage of it.</p>

<p>I know it&#8217;s well after the new year, but I still want these publicly known so that friends and family can hold me accountable.</p>

            <description>There are two Michael Jordan quotes that truly are amazing. Actually, he has quite a few quotes on this topic; the two I am going to focus on are some of my favorites.
 I&amp;#8217;ve missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I&amp;#8217;ve lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I&amp;#8217;ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I&amp;#8217;ve failed over and over and over again in my life.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[

<p>There are two Michael Jordan quotes that truly are amazing. Actually, he has quite a few quotes on this topic; the two I am going to focus on are some of my favorites.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I&#8217;ve lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I&#8217;ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I&#8217;ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed. - Michael Jordan</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="failure-leads-to-success">Failure leads to Success</h2>

<p>I recently wrote <a href="/posts/2011/08/taking-risks-meeting-opportunity" title="Taking Risks; Meeting Opportunity">Taking Risks; Meeting Opportunities</a> because of my own life experiences. I&#8217;ve been too afraid at times to move on; mainly because I&#8217;m afraid of failure myself. However, should you be afraid to fail? Or simply learn from those around you and the mistakes that you&#8217;ve made in your life.</p>

<p>The best example I can currently think of involves Steve Jobs. We all know of the risks he took in the computer and entertainment industries, but amidst his success there was also failure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jobs failed better than anyone else in Silicon Valley, maybe better than anyone in corporate America. By that I mean Jobs did what only the greatest entrepreneurs can do: learn from their failures. I don’t mean learn from their mistakes. I mean learn from their abject, humiliating, bonehead, epic fails. <a href="http://blog.heritage.org/2011/08/26/celebrating-steve-jobs-failures/" target="_blank">Celebrating Steve Jobs&#8217; Failures</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The moral of this post is to accept failure. Own up to your failures and most importantly <strong>never stop learning</strong>. As soon as you give up on learning; you are abandoning success too.</p>

<p>And just because I can, I&#8217;ll leave you with one more MJ quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can accept failure, everyone fails at something. But I can&#8217;t accept not trying.</p>
</blockquote>

            <description>Recently I was talking to an online acquaintance regarding the process of making tough decisions. My question to you is why are you afraid to take the risks that will make you happy?
People are Safe You know what will make you happy don&amp;#8217;t you? So why aren&amp;#8217;t you doing everything you can to do it? I&amp;#8217;ve seen in my life that I need encouragement do try something different. When I saw the coaching position open I was hesitant to apply, why?</description>

<p>Recently I was talking to an online acquaintance regarding the process of making tough decisions. My question to you is <strong>why are you afraid to take the risks that will make you happy?</strong></p>

<h2 id="people-are-safe">People are Safe</h2>

<p>You know what will make you happy don&#8217;t you? So why aren&#8217;t you doing everything you can to <em>do it</em>? I&#8217;ve seen in my life that I need encouragement do try something different. When I saw the coaching position open I was hesitant to apply, why? I knew that I had the knowledge of the sport and a want to coach. I was afraid of change and rejection.</p>

<p>In my job search after college I applied to numerous jobs over a ten month period. I had one interview and one job offer, it&#8217;s the position I hold now. Rejection, even after a year of employment, was still fresh in my mind. I really wanted to hold on to the job I had, and not risk losing it, especially since it pays my bills. However, I figured out that it was possible for the jobs to complement one another and I wanted to do something else with my time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The person who risks nothing, does nothing, has nothing, is nothing, and becomes nothing. He may avoid suffering and sorrow, but he simply cannot learn and feel and change and grow and love and live.” - Leo F. Buscaglia</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="breaking-the-cycle">Breaking the Cycle</h2>

<p>So how do you break the chain on a risk-less life? You take risks! Go do something you wouldn&#8217;t normally do. Apply for that dream job that you aren&#8217;t qualified for. The worst that anyone can say to you is &#8220;no thanks.&#8221; You might be afraid of rejection; but trust me, you&#8217;ll feel even more satisfied when you prove yourself wrong.</p>

<p>And one day, it will pay off. You will apply for the job and get it.</p>

<h2 id="tips-to-succeed">Tips to Succeed</h2>

<p>If you want sure-fire ways to succeed in this, well send me the list too so we&#8217;ll both know. I do, however, have some tips of how to successfully take risks and feel rewarded.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Start Small &#8211;</strong> Take small calculated risks to get warmed up to the big stuff. There&#8217;s no reason to over compensate for your lack of risk taking before.</li>
<li><strong>Be Confident &#8211;</strong> There&#8217;s nothing better than seeing someone who is confident in their skill sets. Believe in what you know and trust what you are doing. Do you think I knew anything about coaching going in? Nope, but I did have knowledge of the sport, how to do the technique and I was confident in relaying what I know to the group.</li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t Let Fear Guide You &#8211;</strong> If you are smart and confident about the risks you are taking and fear will no longer be a factor. Just make sure you aren&#8217;t stepping too far out of your comfort zone too fast or you might take steps backwards. Jumping too far ahead will ruin your risk taking abilities in the future.</li>
</ol>

<p>So what are your thoughts? Why are you afraid to take risks? What tips would you add to people who are afraid to take risks? Input is always welcome and appreciated&#8230;</p>

            <description>Recently I was given a copy of The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership and decided that I will partake in applying these laws to my life online.
My hope is that I can also urge you, my readers and friends, to also partake and keep me accountable for my goals, dreams and ambitions as I also help you.
Major Goals List your major goals. No more than ten; no less than five.</description>

<p>Recently I was given a copy of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/21-Irrefutable-Laws-Leadership-Follow/dp/0785274316" target="_blank">The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership</a></em> and decided that I will partake in applying these laws to my life online.</p>

<p>My hope is that I can also urge you, my readers and friends, to also partake and keep me accountable for my goals, dreams and ambitions as I also help you.</p>

<h2 id="major-goals">Major Goals</h2>

<p>List your major goals. No more than ten; no less than five.</p>

<ol>
<li><del>Become a Head Coach of a HS or Club Program</del> &ndash; Head Coach of Batesville HS, 2017</li>
<li><del>Achieve Level 3 ASCA Certification or Higher</del> &ndash; Achieved in 2013-14</li>
<li>Prove my self as knowledgeable in Leadership/Coaching</li>
<li>Become a speaker on leadership and motivation for athletes/workers</li>
<li>Get involved with post-college athletic groups, such as Master&rsquo;s Swimming programs</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="leadership-abilities">Leadership Abilities</h2>

<p>Assess your leadership ability.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Strengths</strong> &#8211; Legacy, Growth, Buy-In, The Picture, Empowerment, Inner Circle, Magnetism, Intuition, Respect, Solid Ground, and Addition. From what I gather, it goes along the same lines of other analysis that I have done. I&#8217;m attracted to people and people are generally attracted to me. Essentially, I am a people person. I like to network and talk, and can seemingly gain their trust through example.</li>
<li><strong>Needs Work</strong> &#8211; Timing, Sacrifice, Priorities, Momentum, Victory, Navigation, Influence, the Lid. What this is telling me is that I have to do a better job of increasing my effectiveness as a leader and rate on a better scale. Not only that, but I also need the willingness to sacrifice my personal time and set better priorities for myself and my teams that I work with.</li>
<li><strong>Weaknesses</strong> &#8211; Process. Upon the first completion of the analysis this is the only area that is a true weakness. The process at which I grow needs work. I&#8217;d like some help in how to develop a prices of personal growth that I can engage in and would like some classes, articles or books to help improve myself in this category.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="peer-rating">Peer Rating</h2>

<p>Finally, ask others to rate your leadership ability.</p>

            <description>This image was captured while on vacation at Ft Myers Beach. Sarah and I were walking along the beach to this pier on our second to last morning and I decided to capture this as a Hand-Held HDR photo. All things considered, I really like the way it turned out. Not sure how I was able to capture the waves, but I&amp;#8217;m glad that I did.</description>

            <description>Everyone&amp;#8217;s busy. How do you manage to get a workout in? Do you have an expensive gym membership? Do you just walk or run around your neighborhood? Or do you have trouble finding the motivation to do a workout?
Today, I&amp;#8217;m going to give you just a few simple workout ideas using nothing but a resistance band, AKA Stretch Cords.
Resistance bands come in different lengths and resistance levels. The nice thing about using resistance bands is that you don&amp;#8217;t have to worry about dropping something heavy on your foot, so this makes for a nice workout even when you are alone.</description>

<p>Everyone&#8217;s busy. How do you manage to get a workout in? Do you have an expensive gym membership? Do you just walk or run around your neighborhood? Or do you have trouble finding the motivation to do a workout?</p>

<p>Today, I&#8217;m going to give you just a few simple workout ideas using nothing but a resistance band, AKA Stretch Cords.</p>

<p>Resistance bands come in different lengths and resistance levels. The nice thing about using resistance bands is that you don&#8217;t have to worry about dropping something heavy on your foot, so this makes for a nice workout even when you are alone.</p>

<h2 id="find-the-bands-that-work-for-you">Find the Bands that work for You</h2>

<p>Luckily for the consumer, some giant supermarket stores have a variety pack of Resistance bands. The package that I purchased a few years back included 2 short bands, 2 long and some weird ankle thing (I never have used it) and handles.</p>

<p>This is great because you get multiple resistances easily, and you can adjust between sets or between various exercises. If one band is too light, switch to the other. Still not what you want? Use both!</p>

<h2 id="3-simple-workouts">3 Simple Workouts</h2>

<p>In these workouts make sure you are slow and controlled. The best part about using the band is that you can truly feel when you are out of control.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Bicep Curl</strong> &#8211; Stand with your feet shoulder width apart (SWA) on the band. Make sure the band is tight enough to give you resistance while standing straight. Loop the band by your feet and stand on it to adjust resistance.</li>
<li><strong>Tricep Extension</strong> &#8211; Stand w/feet SWA and pull the band over your head. Extend your arms until they are straight. I recommend keeping the band BEHIND you. Also, make sure to keep your elbows in towards your head.</li>
<li><strong>Figure 8&#8217;s</strong> &#8211; Start with your arms at your side. Again Feet are SWA. Make a figure 8 with your hand and arm. Your Palm should always be facing the way you are moving. This is very useful for people with Rotator Cuff problems.</li>
<li><strong>Others</strong> &#8211; For more workout ideas with a Resistance band visit the <a title="Resistance Band Excercises" href="http://www.sportsinjuryclinic.net/strengthening/resistancebands.php">Sports Injury Clinic website</a></li>
</ul>

<p>All you have to do is couple this with some ab work and maybe a quick run and you&#8217;ve got a full body workout without ever having to go to the gym.</p>

<p>Now, these are some very simple workouts that you can do at home or even at the office for a short break. I wish you all the best and feel free to post any questions or comments below!</p>

            <title>Determining your Motivation Style</title>

            <description>If you&amp;#8217;ve ever watched a college basketball game, the coaching staff in the locker room is trying to &amp;#8220;psych&amp;#8221; up the team. Sometimes it works; however, it also creates undue stress in what could be your top performers.
Motivation isn&amp;#8217;t taught. It&amp;#8217;s also something that a coach or parent isn&amp;#8217;t in control of. Allowing an athlete the ability to stay relaxed in a familiar environment is more motivating than anything a coach or parent can say.</description>

<p>If you&#8217;ve ever watched a college basketball game, the coaching staff in the locker room is trying to &#8220;psych&#8221; up the team. Sometimes it works; however, it also creates undue stress in what could be your top performers.</p>

<p>Motivation isn&#8217;t taught. It&#8217;s also something that a coach or parent isn&#8217;t in control of. Allowing an athlete the ability to stay relaxed in a familiar environment is more motivating than anything a coach or parent can say. Staying relaxed and following your routine is vital to performing at your best level.</p>

<h2 id="motivational-styles">Motivational Styles</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Fear</strong> – The &#8220;If you don&#8217;t do it, you&#8217;ll pay&#8221; mentality. An old school approach. Punishment is NOT a motivating factor. It actually causes people to tense up and play/work worse than they would if they were in a calm mindset.</li>
<li><strong>Incentives</strong> – &#8220;If you do it, you can have _____ in return.&#8221; This works for some people, however it creates an &#8220;entitled&#8221; generation. Creates a &#8220;what do I get in return&#8221; culture and doesn&#8217;t create a self-starter.</li>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong> – This is where a coach, parent or boss&#8217; should focus. It creates a long-term motivational effect. Setting seasonal, monthly and/or yearly goals are the best way to motivate through purpose. It’s not just a coach or boss that needs to set these goals. Talk to your team and have them set the goals. Goals should mesh with what you are trying to carry out in your program. In turn, these goals will help people meet end of the season/year incentives. These can include: Work Bonuses, MVP Awards or even a chance to take part at a State competition.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, how do I motivate people around me? I give them praise for doing well and recognize their hard work. Sometimes just saying &#8220;Thanks for working hard this week&#8221; will give someone enough motivation to keep it up. I also allow them the chance to relax they way they want, while making sure they are in the correct physical and mental shape. There is one last piece of the puzzle that I have not mentioned. You have motivate yourself. Is it possible to lead a team as an unmotivated leader? In short, no, you need motivation to motivate others. People will feed off of it and give you the best results.</p>

<p>Now it&#8217;s your turn! How do you motivate your employees, athletes or children? How do you motivate yourself? Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments below.</p>

            <description>Success is Peace of Mind which is a direct result of self satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do the best of which you are capable. - John Wooden
 If you were one of the many Americans watching the Women&amp;#8217;s National team make a run toward the FIFA Women&amp;#8217;s World Cup Final were you disappointed?
By looking at the team accomplishments, you&amp;#8217;ll proud!

<p>If you were one of the many Americans watching the Women&#8217;s National team make a run toward the <a title="FIFA Women's World Cup" href="http://www.fifa.com/womensworldcup/index.html">FIFA Women&#8217;s World Cup</a> Final were you disappointed?</p>

<p>By looking at the team accomplishments, you&#8217;ll proud!</p>

<h2 id="team-usa-accomplishments">Team USA Accomplishments</h2>

<ul>
<li>Hope Solo went 1,054 minutes without allowing a goal.</li>
<li>Team USA only lost 3 matches in 2011 &#8211; Four Nations Tournament, International Friendly and to Sweden in the Women&#8217;s World Cup.</li>
<li>Made it to the World Cup Final defeating Brazil. Undoubtedly a top contender.</li>
</ul>

<p>So in all honesty, why be disappointed about? The women&#8217;s soccer program was rejuvenated by the 2011 World Cup because of their performance.</p>

<p>I know people don&#8217;t like to lose, but sometimes you have to look at the entire result of a game, meet or match. Did you do more than you ever thought you could? Did you improve upon previous attempts? Did your team come together in a time of struggle?</p>

<p>These things are more important than winning. While it can help boost a team&#8217;s morale by winning the big game, it&#8217;s your job as a parent, coach or friend to make the team realize that they did a hell of a job even without the &#8220;W&#8221;.</p>

<p>So how do you manage to overcome disappointment? Are you irritated when you lose or are you happy to get a chance? Share your thoughts.</p>

            <description>I was recently interviewed for a head coach job at a swim club. I surprised myself when I was asked the question.
 What makes you different/better than the next person that we bring in?
 My response, &amp;#8220;Nothing.&amp;#8221;
What the @#$^% are you thinking? How am I supposed to know what makes me different from people I&amp;#8217;ve never met? For all I know they could be 30 years old and have coached for 15 years, am I better than them?</description>

<p>My response, &#8220;Nothing.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="what-the-are-you-thinking">What the @#$^% are you thinking?</h2>

<p>How am I supposed to know what makes me different from people I&#8217;ve never met? For all I know they could be 30 years old and have coached for 15 years, am I better than them? No.</p>

<p>What truly sets me apart, in my mind, is that I&#8217;ve found what I&#8217;m passionate about. Swimming was my first love when it came to athletics. It brought about some of the best times in my life and created the tightest bond with a great group of friends that I will always have by my side.</p>

<p>Who is one person that you’ve been dying to connect with, but just haven’t had the courage to reach out to? First, reflect on why you want to get in touch with them. Then, reach out and set up a meeting.</p>

<hr />

<p>Recently, I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of research on swimming, which may come as no surprise to any of you out there. One of the sites that I like to frequent is by Former Olympic Swimmer Glenn Mills, <a href="http://goswim.tv" target="_blank">GoSwim.tv</a></p>

<h2 id="why-do-i-want-to-reach-out">Why do I want to reach out?</h2>

<p>While I feel like the connections I&#8217;m making in Indianapolis and the surrounding areas are valuable, it&#8217;s always nice to have an experienced mentor. Someone you can ask questions, get advice from and look up to. The head coach at Pike is a great resource and I know that he&#8217;s dedicated to the sport (ASCA Level 3 Coach), but isn&#8217;t it nice to have more than one person to discuss (tips, techniques, ideas, etc) with?</p>

<p>Coach Mills has been involved in swimming for over 30 years and has truly been tested, strained and has proven his techniques work by being certified as an ASCA Level 5 Coach. View <a href="http://www.goswim.tv/entries/768/glenn-mills.html" target="_blank">Glenn Mills&#8217; bio</a> on GoSwim.tv.</p>

<p>To give you a better idea what the coaching levels mean here&#8217;s an excerpt from the <a href="http://www.swimmingcoach.org/pdf/certapp.pdf" target="_blank"><em>ASCA Coaches Certification the Purpose and the Process</em></a>. (PDF)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are three things analyzed in the Certification process. They are: Education, Experience and Achievement. Your Certification shows that you have met the required standard at each Level. The Five Levels become increasingly difficult. Level 5 is composed of the top 2-5% of coaches in the USA. Level 4 is the top 5-8% and Level 3 is the upper 15% of coaches. Level 2 requires more “units” of education and experience than Level 1.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="how-will-i-reach-out">How will I reach out?</h2>

<p>Well, I honestly already have. I follow Coach Mills on Twitter (@GoSwim), read and watch his coaching ideas or technique tips and (attempt) to comment on things that interest and intrigue me.</p>

<p>My plan is to continue on this approach, ask questions and get insight on how to become a better coach and leader.</p>

<p>Who is someone you are afraid to reach out and connect with? Why are you afraid? How can you overcome that fear? Share your thoughts and this post, it&#8217;s always appreciated.</p>

            <description>Job searching is a necessary part of your professional life. However, there are some do&amp;#8217;s and don&amp;#8217;ts. Right now I&amp;#8217;m going to talk about something that hits very close to home when it comes to searching for your next job or even your dream career.
While the title of this post hints at what not to do I also want to touch on a few things that you should do.</description>

<p>Job searching is a necessary part of your professional life. However, there are some do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts. Right now I&#8217;m going to talk about something that hits very close to home when it comes to searching for your next job or even your dream career.</p>

<p>While the title of this post hints at what <em>not</em> to do I also want to touch on a few things that you should do.</p>

<h2 id="what-not-to-do-8230">What NOT to Do&#8230;</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>Get Discouraged:</strong>

<ul>
<li>So you&#8217;re sending out 30 resumes a day and aren&#8217;t hearing anything back. That doesn&#8217;t mean give up does it? No! It means that you should constantly rework your documents to the best of your ability. Heck, you could even send it to a mentor for advice.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Be Afraid to Ask for Help:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Students everywhere have advisors and mentors willing to help you out. Use those resources to your fullest potential. I recently applied for an Aquatics Director position at the Avon YMCA (currently being built) and I didn&#8217;t get a call back or anything. What did I do? I messaged the HR Manager through LinkedIn and asked how I could improve. She gave me recommendations and I&#8217;ve been researching and looking into getting the certifications she suggested.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Burn Bridges:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Just because you didn&#8217;t get hired, you shouldn&#8217;t let them know they missed out in such a strong way that they would never consider you again. Employers may not have had a position for you at that particular point, but it&#8217;s no reason to say, &#8220;It&#8217;s your loss.&#8221;</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-to-do-8230">What to Do&#8230;</h2>

<p>Listed below, you can see some suggestions of how to boost your job searching abilities.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Spruce Up Your Resume:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Stop sending the same old resume to new companies. Especially, if you aren&#8217;t getting any call backs. A strong and up-to-date resume is a great way to persuade someone to call you. Try a new design and stop using the default &#8220;Word&#8221; templates. See <a href="http://twitter.com/robbyslaughter" target="_blank">@robbyslaughter</a>&#8216;s resume. <a href="http://www.robbyslaughter.com/resume_for_robby_slaughter.pdf" target="_blank">Robby&#8217;s Resume!</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Improve your Writing:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Maybe you have been passing out a stale or dull cover letter. You really need to grasp your reader&#8217;s attention in the first 10-15 seconds! If you&#8217;re lucky, they&#8217;ll keep reading and put you in the &#8220;follow-up&#8221; pile.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Be Personable:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Stop rewriting the same cover letter time in and time out. Write for your audience. If you are applying for jobs at XYZ Company show that you&#8217;ve got some insight on who they are and what they do. Also make sure you share how you will help their company.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>I wish anyone and everyone the best of luck and I&#8217;m also interested in hearing your do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts! Please feel free to leave your suggestions in the comments below.</p>

            <description>I will not hide my tastes or aversions. I will so trust that what is deep is holy, if we follow the truth, it will bring us out safe at last. – Ralph Waldo Emerson
 Think of a time when you didn’t think you were capable of doing something, but then surprised yourself. How will you surprise yourself this week?
You want to know something about me? I don&amp;#8217;t run, ever!</description>

<p>Think of a time when you didn’t think you were capable of doing something, but then surprised yourself. How will you surprise yourself this week?</p>

<hr />

<p>You want to know something about me? I don&#8217;t run, ever! Running is my Kryptonite. The reason I have such a problem with it is:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have bad knees</li>
<li>I have a bad back</li>
<li>I hate it</li>
<li>It makes me feel like death</li>
<li>It just plain sucks&#8230;</li>
</ul>

<p>So you can imagine what I was thinking when my beautiful girlfriend says &#8220;Greg, _<strong>_</strong> and _<strong>_</strong> want us to join them in the <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/cin/community/race.jsp" target="_blank">Redlegs Run</a>. Of course, me being the guy that I am I tell her &#8220;okay!&#8221; This is also when I had JUST received my new Nike+ Running System and I thought I would use it all the time&#8230;.not so much.</p>

<h2 id="8220-training-8221">&#8220;Training..&#8221;</h2>

<p>Now, here I am donning my brand new Nike Shox (which I do love), my new iPod Nano and my Nike+ hitting the gym just about every day for about&#8230;oh&#8230;2 weeks (maybe 3). I was utilizing the Coach/Training program that the system had suggested for running a 10k to make sure I had some stamina for the races. Oh yeah, did I mention we registered for BOTH the 10k and 5k&#8230;</p>

<p>Needless to say, my training didn&#8217;t go well&#8230;</p>

<h2 id="closer-to-the-race-8230">Closer to the Race&#8230;</h2>

<p>Sarah starts hitting me with the &#8220;you should probably start running so you are ready for the race!&#8221; I just shrugged it off and said I&#8217;d be fine. She was running about 2 miles 3-4 times a week, whereas I just wanted to lounge around after getting off of work.</p>

<p>Honestly, she was right I should have worked harder for the race.</p>

<h2 id="the-night-before-and-race-day-8230">The Night Before and Race Day&#8230;</h2>

<p>Friday before the race I headed out to my parent&#8217;s house to drop off some of my non-essential running gear and spent some time with my dad. He asked me &#8220;are you ready for the race?&#8221; I immediately replied, &#8220;heck no, I&#8217;m just gonna give it my best.&#8221;</p>

<p>Later that evening, I headed over to Sarah&#8217;s parents house and right before bed I tweeted out (after taking some Alieve and using IcyHot on my back and knee):</p>

            <description>Imitation is Suicide. Insist on yourself; never imitate. – Ralph Waldo Emerson
 Write down in which areas of your life you have to overcome these suicidal tendencies of imitation, and how you can transform them into a newborn you – one that doesn’t hide its uniqueness, but thrives on it. There is a &amp;#8220;divine idea which each of us represents&amp;#8221; – which is yours?
Every day I fight with the owner of my organization about trying something new within the realm of marketing.</description>

<p>Write down in which areas of your life you have to overcome these suicidal tendencies of imitation, and how you can transform them into a newborn you – one that doesn’t hide its uniqueness, but thrives on it. There is a &#8220;divine idea which each of us represents&#8221; – which is yours?</p>

<hr />

<p>Every day I fight with the owner of my organization about trying something new within the realm of marketing. He&#8217;s dead set on looking at all of the other companies in the industry and saying &#8220;Well, they aren&#8217;t doing it, so why would I?&#8221; Being a true leader in an industry is what keeps you alive!</p>

<p>This quote is absolutely right. Imitation is suicide. You have to learn to differentiate yourself. People have said that imitation is a form of flattery, but is it really? No! It&#8217;s annoying. Anyone with a sibling knows how annoying a copy cat is. Making yourself different from your peers is what makes you &#8220;you.&#8221;</p>

<p>My goal every single day is to try and find who I am what I want to do and what/where I want to be in my life. That doesn&#8217;t come from being a copy cat; it comes from hard work and dedication&#8230;to you.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts on the subject? What is your &#8220;Divine Idea&#8221; that represents you?</p>

            <description>To believe your own thought, to believe that what is true for you in your private heart is true for all men, that is genius. – Ralph Waldo Emerson
 What is burning deep inside of you? If you could spread your personal message RIGHT NOW to 1 million people, what would you say?
If I had the chance to share my personal message with anyone, it would always be the same.</description>

            <description>The other terror that scares us from self-trust is our consistency; a reverence for our past act or word, because the eyes of others have no other data for computing our orbit than our past acts, and we are loath to disappoint them. &amp;#8211; Ralph Waldo Emerson
Emerson says: “Always do what you are afraid to do.” What is ‘too scary’ to write about? Try doing it now.
So I wasn&amp;#8217;t really sure about what to write on this prompt.</description>

<p>The other terror that scares us from self-trust is our consistency; a reverence for our past act or word, because the eyes of others have no other data for computing our orbit than our past acts, and we are loath to disappoint them. &#8211; Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>

<p>Emerson says: “Always do what you are afraid to do.” What is ‘too scary’ to write about? Try doing it now.</p>

<hr />

<p>So I wasn&#8217;t really sure about what to write on this prompt. I know that many of my fears and personal challenges involve choosing the proper career path for myself. However, I was talking with Sarah and she gave me a GREAT idea for what to write about. So here it is, a list of my top 10 fears.</p>

<h3 id="my-top-10-fears-in-no-particular-order">My Top 10 Fears (in no particular order):</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Getting Married</strong> &#8211; Sarah and I have been together for well over 6 years now. I&#8217;m entirely confident that she&#8217;s the one. It&#8217;s just&#8230;well&#8230;I have cold feet and nerves. It&#8217;s almost like they stay in Antarctica year round.</li>
<li><strong>Losing my Parents</strong> &#8211; I&#8217;ve already lost all but one Grandparent (two before I was even born) and that was hard enough on me, my brother and my parents. I can&#8217;t even imagine what it would feel like to lose a parent.</li>
<li>T<strong>elling my Parents and Brother how I truly feel</strong> &#8211; I know I love them, but I just have a hard time <em>saying</em> it.</li>
<li>L<strong>osing contact with my closest friends</strong> &#8211; Marriage, kids and jobs. These all have the same thing in common. Taking too much time from people to do other things. I know it&#8217;s unrealistic to think we can see each other every weekend again. Seeing them once or twice a year isn&#8217;t quite enough.</li>
<li><strong>Not being able to pay my bills</strong> &#8211; With a car payment, two student loans, utilities, rent and a few other things it seems like money is hard to come by. I make enough to live currently, but jobs aren&#8217;t guaranteed no matter how hard you work.</li>
<li><strong>Buying a first place</strong> &#8211; As with all 20-somethings you have to consider buying your first place. Finding something within your price range and being able pay the bills (all of them) on time every time with a home is still a challenge and fear.</li>
<li><strong>Semi-Trailer Trucks</strong> &#8211; When I was 16, I was involved in an accident involving a semi. The tow company said had I rotated even another degree the air bag would not have deployed and I may not be here at this point.</li>
<li><strong>Spiders</strong> &#8211; I have some inherent fear of spiders&#8230;and they are just gross</li>
<li><strong>Storms</strong> &#8211; Yes Sarah, I&#8217;ll put it on here for you! I&#8217;m mainly afraid of DRIVING in storms and bad weather.</li>
<li><strong>Free Falling</strong> &#8211; After talking with some people on Twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/bgkahuna" target="_blank">@bgKahuna</a>) I realized that I left this one off. I really can&#8217;t stand the feeling of free falling, which is the root cause to why I don&#8217;t like roller coasters and will never sky dive. <del datetime="2011-06-09T12:59:05+00:00"><strong>The NFL Lockout</strong> &#8211; I WANT ME SOME FOOTBALL!</del></li>
</ol>

<p>To be honest I tried to think of 10 serious ideas but I really couldn&#8217;t come with any hence you get the last four on this list&#8230;</p>

<p>What are some of your fears? You don&#8217;t necessarily have to have 10, but share them! It&#8217;ll be awesome if you do. Please feel free to share your thoughts in the comment section of the site and share this with your friends with the methods below. Thanks!</p>

<p>What would you say to the person you were five years ago? What will you say to the person you’ll be in five years?</p>

<hr />

<p>Five years ago, I was in transition between the University of Evansville and Xavier University. The year was disappointing to me. First, I was over three hours away from the love of my life. Second, I failed to finish the first year of my collegiate swimming career. Finally, I completely messed up my back due to a weight lifting incident.</p>

<h3 id="what-would-i-tell-myself-from-five-years-ago">What would I tell myself from five years ago?</h3>

<p>Stay at UE! You went here because you had a chance to continue your swimming career. When we visited you fell in love with the campus and you will get a great education too. While the doctors said that your back would never be the same, you can adjust to it and will quickly.</p>

<p>Life will never be easy, but you don&#8217;t want to take the easy road. Continue on with your education until you feel like you are in a good spot to obtain the career of your dreams. Don&#8217;t forget to thank your friends and family for their support and love.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-five-years-from-now">What about five years from now?</h3>

<p>Hmm. This one is tougher since I&#8217;m not entirely sure where I&#8217;ll be in five years. The first thing I would say is &#8220;thanks.&#8221; Thanks for making it this far and (hopefully) congratulations on whatever accomplishments I&#8217;ve made.</p>

<p>The last thing I would say is, &#8220;keep moving on, and don’t stop working towards your dreams. Always be there for your family and support their dreams as well. Don&#8217;t give up on what you believe in.&#8221;</p>

<p>So&#8230;now it&#8217;s your turn. How would you approach yourself five years ago? In five years?</p>

            <description>Our arts, our occupations, our marriages, our religion, we have not chosen, but society has chosen for us. We are parlour soldiers. We shun the rugged battle of fate, where strength is born. – Ralph Waldo Emerson
 Next to Resistance, rational thought is the artist or entrepreneurs worst enemy. Bad things happen when we employ rational thought, because rational thought comes from the ego. Instead, we want to work from the Self, that is, from instinct and intuition, from the unconscious.</description>

</blockquote>

<p>The idea of “being realistic” holds all of us back. From starting a business or quitting a job to dating someone who may not be our type or moving to a new place – getting “real” often means putting your dreams on hold.</p>

<p>Today, let’s take a step away from rational thought and dare to be bold. What’s one thing you’ve always wanted to accomplish but have been afraid to pursue? Write it down. Also write down the obstacles in your way of reaching your goal. Finally, write down a tangible plan to overcome each obstacle.</p>

<p>The only thing left is to, you know, actually go make it happen. What are you waiting for?</p>

<hr />

<p>In my last post, I talked about how I don&#8217;t regret the way that my life has gone. While that is true, I still have room for improvement. There&#8217;s one thing that is immediately coming to mind about being <em>rational</em> with my life. My job.</p>

<p>Sarah and I have talked about going down the path of me quitting, going back to school (or not) and pursuing my coaching career AS a career. However, through our talks we have since realized it&#8217;s not feasible since it currently will not pay enough to cover the costs of living.</p>

<h2 id="obstacles-8230">Obstacles&#8230;</h2>

<p>There are three areas that are currently in the way of getting my <a href="/posts/2010/08/chasing-your-dream-job">dream job</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Experience</strong>

<ul>
<li>Companies of all industries aren&#8217;t willing to risk paying an inexperienced employee. Why? I don&#8217;t know. Aren&#8217;t there enough examples of young guns that have been very successful? Does the name Brad Stevens ring a bell? Butler could have hired a well versed coach, but did they? No.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Uncertainty of a Livable Wage</strong>

<ul>
<li>This scares me the most of all. I know what I&#8217;ve been paid for a typical High School Swim Season and I also know that athletic and art funds have been cut. How can I justify quitting my job when I don&#8217;t know if I can get a full time job? Maybe I should ask Brad Stevens&#8230;</li>
<li>I have no other income to fall back on. Sarah and I have talked about me taking this path. The only problem, she is still a student. Med Student = Limited or No Income + Loans</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Lack of Full Support</strong></li>
<li>Sarah encouraged me to pursue the High School Coaching job but has also talked me into keeping my current Full Time employment, which I am extremely thankful for. The only reason I don&#8217;t have full support is because I have yet to talk to other people about it and that is all on me.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="overcoming-the-obstacles-8230">Overcoming the Obstacles&#8230;</h2>

<p><strong>Experience:</strong> Be thankful that the Red Devil Aquatics Club and Pike High School have offered me the current position that I have. Continue working on developing my coaching skills. Possibly get more experience from picking up extra coaching time with the Middle School and Club programs.</p>

<p><strong>Wages:</strong> Continue working with my current employer, whom gives me flexible hours to pursue this dream, to get off work early and have the extra weekend time off to coach and mentor the kids. Do everything in my power and skill set to continue working full time and as a part time coach until I have someone to help me or enough saved up to live.</p>

<p><strong>Support:</strong> Talk to family and friends. Get their opinions and suggestions on how to approach and manage the career change and lifestyle. Work with previous coaches and find how they worked it out when times got rough.</p>

<p>I know my posts have been repetitive in talking about my dream job, but it&#8217;s something that I am very passionate about and I feel like I am holding myself back by not pursuing it more.</p>

<p>I appreciate anyone and everyone reading these posts and would welcome you to share your obstacles of what you are scared to pursue. So tell me, what are you afraid of?</p>

            <description>Life wastes itself while we are preparing to live. – Ralph Waldo Emerson
 If you had one week left to live, would you still be doing what you’re doing now? In what areas of your life are you preparing to live? Take them off your To Do list and add them to a To Stop list. Resolve to only do what makes you come alive.
Bonus: How can your goals improve the present and not keep you in a perpetual “always something better” spiral?</description>

<p>If you had one week left to live, would you still be doing what you’re doing now? In what areas of your life are you preparing to live? Take them off your To Do list and add them to a To Stop list. Resolve to only do what makes you come alive.</p>

<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> How can your goals improve the present and not keep you in a perpetual “always something better” spiral?</p>

<hr />

<p>This is another difficult post to write since I feel like my life is complete. While you some of you may be right saying, “How can your life be complete you aren’t married nor do you have kids.” You’re absolutely right, I am not currently <em>married</em> nor do I have little one’s running rampant. What I do have is a life with very little regret. However, there are a few things left that I would like to accomplish. However, I’m going to take the same approach as this fellow <a href="http://www.richproctor.com/2011/06/trust30-come-alive.html?spref=tw" target="_blank">Trust30 blogger, Rich Proctor</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>What if I only had a week to totally change the direction my life, or my life would be taken from me?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This will also coincide with the <a href="/posts/2011/06/trust30-post-it-and-wait">Post-It and Wait</a> post I wrote 2 days ago.</p>

<h2 id="i-would">I would…</h2>

<ol>
<li>Continue with my Coaching Career</li>
<li>Go back to school and get a degree to facilitate my career</li>
<li>Attempt to obtain CPR/Life Guard Trainers Certification</li>
<li>Get my Scuba Diving Certification</li>
<li>Spend less time in front of my electronics</li>
<li>Enjoy more time with friends and family</li>
<li>Get off my butt and exercise more</li>
<li>Travel, travel, travel</li>
<li>Figure out how to get the car of my dreams, the <a href="http://ow.ly/5aGd7" target="_blank">Nissan GT-R</a></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="i-wouldn-t">I wouldn’t…</h2>

<ol>
<li>Buy the iPad I’ve talked about</li>
<li>Quit Blogging – It’s making me a lot more conscience of who I am</li>
<li>Scuba Dive Alone &#8211; Sarah…hint hint 😉</li>
<li>Ditch my Versa! (ever)</li>
</ol>

<p>All of these things would also help me obtain my Dream Job of being a full time Coach (except the car) and honestly, this post suffices as my Day 4 and Day 6 post.</p></p>

<p>What about you? Feel free to use the original prompt or the modified one by <a href="http://www.richproctor.com/" target="_blank">Rich Proctor</a>. I’d like to know your story too.</p>

            <description>If we live truly, we shall see truly. &amp;#8211; Ralph Waldo Emerson
 Not everyone wants to travel the world, but most people can identify at least one place in the world they’d like to visit before they die. Where is that place for you, and what will you do to make sure you get there?
I&amp;#8217;ve been lucky&amp;#8230; While I was still in school I was able to travel to the one place outside of the US that I&amp;#8217;ve always wanted to visit, the Republic of Ireland.</description>

<p>Not everyone wants to travel the world, but most people can identify at least one place in the world they’d like to visit before they die. Where is that place for you, and what will you do to make sure you get there?</p>

<h2 id="i-8217-ve-been-lucky-8230">I&#8217;ve been lucky&#8230;</h2>

<p>While I was still in school I was able to travel to the one place outside of the US that I&#8217;ve always wanted to visit, <a href="http://www.discoverireland.com/int/" target="_blank">the Republic of Ireland</a>. I was able to travel here thanks to a study abroad program over the summer in 2008.</p>

<p>The reason that I&#8217;ve wanted to go to Ireland was because my family has told me that our ancestors are from there. The trip lasted for two weeks and was absolutely amazing.</p>

<h2 id="my-travel-plans-aren-8217-t-for-me-8230">My travel plans aren&#8217;t for me&#8230;</h2>

<p>That&#8217;s right, now I know that this challenge is supposed to allow you to look closer into your own life so you can trust yourself. However, my goal for traveling is setting up a trip for my entire family to go to Ireland. My family&#8217;s last vacation was in 1995, which wasn&#8217;t even a full family vacation.</p>

<p>My parent&#8217;s (dad more so) have always expressed how much they&#8217;ve wanted to travel to Ireland so they could see where our McMullen family comes from. It&#8217;s an amazing trip and I would highly recommend it for anyone.</p>

<h2 id="additional-travel-plans-8230">Additional Travel Plans&#8230;</h2>

<p>I wouldn&#8217;t say that I&#8217;m entirely apt to travel, however, I would enjoy seeing some of the following places before I take the plunge into the dirt:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Grand Canyon (saw it in 2016 on my way to Vegas, I think)</li>
<li>Redwood Forest</li>
<li>Rome</li>
<li>Greece</li>
</ul>

<p>Where would you like to travel? How are you going to make sure that you get there? Share your thoughts in the comments!</p>

Where is the master who could have instructed Franklin, or Washington, or Bacon, or Newton? &amp;hellip; Shakespeare will never be made by the study of Shakespeare. Do that which is assigned you, and you cannot hope too much or dare too much. – Ralph Waldo Emerson
 Identify one of your biggest challenges at the moment (ie I don’t feel passionate about my work) and turn it into a question (ie How can I do work I’m passionate about?</description>

</blockquote>

<p>Identify one of your biggest challenges at the moment (ie I don’t feel passionate about my work) and turn it into a question (ie How can I do work I’m passionate about?) Write it on a post-it and put it up on your bathroom mirror or the back of your front door. After 48-hours, journal what answers came up for you and be sure to evaluate them.</p>

<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> tweet or blog a photo of your post-it.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve ever met me you&#8217;ve already realized that working with computers isn&#8217;t necessarily something I&#8217;m crazy about. It definitely used to be a passion and something I thought I wanted (hence the minor in IT in College). However, after working nearly two years in &#8220;the biz&#8221; I&#8217;ve realized it&#8217;s not for me.</p>

<p>Here are some things that I already know I need to figure out:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do I need to go back to school?</li>
<li>How can I do what I love and get paid enough for it?</li>
<li>Can my dream job pay for my life expenses?</li>
<li>Where can I find the best resources for my dream?</li>
</ul>

<p>Here in a few days I&#8217;m going to write up a blog post regarding my personal goals one of which will include my dream job.</p>

<p>What would your post-it note say? How would you go about overcoming the challenge?</p>

            <description>It is easy in the world to live after the world’s opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude. &amp;#8211; Ralph Waldo Emerson, Self-Reliance
 The world is powered by passionate people, powerful ideas, and fearless action. What’s one strong belief you possess that isn’t shared by your closest friends or family?</description>

</blockquote>

<p>The world is powered by passionate people, powerful ideas, and fearless action. What’s one strong belief you possess that isn’t shared by your closest friends or family? What inspires this belief, and what have you done to actively live it?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve read a few different posts regarding today&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23trust30" target="_blank">#trust30</a> prompt, 2 of them were regarding religion. While I do feel like my thoughts on religion are different from most of my friends and family that&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m going to focus on here.</p>

<p>While visiting Ireland back in 2008 I was talking to a few individuals in a pub and a gentleman said, &#8220;All Americans are the same, you only live to work! We work so that we can live&#8230;&#8221; He was entirely right, Americans have been classically trained to do nothing but work. After taking my job I realized that everyone there has that mentality that work comes first, and I knew for sure that I didn&#8217;t want to be sucked into that mindset.</p>

<p>Now, I know that I&#8217;ve been given something completely new to my workplace, short hours. So yes, I do get off work at 2:00 and get to enjoy a majority of the afternoon. However, this is where the difference lies. When I&#8217;m off work, I&#8217;m out of the office and off work. Meaning, I rarely respond my e-mail, although I will check it for emergencies using my Blackberry, and I take the time to do things that I enjoy. Around my workplace most people come into work at 6 and don&#8217;t leave until about 6 or 7 that evening.</p>

<p>Live your life to the fullest. Yes, you will have to work, but there is not a single reason why it should interfere with your dreams and passions. I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to have the short schedule so when I&#8217;m not coaching I can come home and relax, go to the gym or even coach swimming (a true passion). Don&#8217;t let work overtake your life.</p>

            <description>Today&amp;#8217;s task seems slightly more daunting than yesterday. Somehow I am supposed to describe my day in only one sentence. Shouldn&amp;#8217;t be too hard&amp;#8230;right? Author Liz Danzico.
 &amp;#8220;Your genuine action will explain itself, and will explain your other genuine actions. Your conformity explains nothing. The force of character is cumulative. – Ralph Waldo Emerson, Self-Reliance&amp;#8221;
 My Response: Don&amp;#8217;t let today get in the way of the rest of your life; you&amp;#8217;ll have struggles but keep your friends and family close, they&amp;#8217;re the best support you&amp;#8217;ll ever need.</description>

            <description>In an effort to improve my writing skills and to post more frequently I have decided to join the #Trust30 effort. Luckily I won&amp;#8217;t have to be too creative as there will be prompts for me to write about. Today&amp;#8217;s prompt by Gwen Bell is &amp;#8220;15 Minutes to Live&amp;#8221;
 &amp;#8220;We are afraid of truth, afraid of fortune, afraid of death, and afraid of each other. Our age yields no great and perfect persons.</description>

Today&#8217;s prompt by <a href="https://twitter.com/gwenbell" target="_blank">Gwen Bell</a> is &#8220;15 Minutes to Live&#8221;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;We are afraid of truth, afraid of fortune, afraid of death, and afraid of each other. Our age yields no great and perfect persons. – Ralph Waldo Emerson&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are the last notes that I would write to my friends and family:</p>

<p><strong>Mom and Dad:</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately I&#8217;ve been told that I&#8217;ve only been given 15 more minutes to live. I just want you to know that I have appreciated absolutely everything you&#8217;ve ever done for me. You supported all of my dreams and ambitions and even pushed me toward goals that I never thought I&#8217;d be able to reach. I just want you to know that I&#8217;m sorry that I wasn&#8217;t around nearly enough to help you.</p>

<p>I know I don&#8217;t say it nearly enough, but I love you both and wish I could have spent this time with you.</p>

<p><strong>To Lloyd, Kyle, &amp; Mike:</strong></p>

<p>You three have been the best friends that anyone can ask for. Kyle, I&#8217;m sorry that I wasn&#8217;t able to see you in Florida but I&#8217;m glad that my last weekend here was during your wedding. Lloyd, take care of the kids and make sure that your wife doesn&#8217;t corrupt them by having them support the Bengals. Mike, keep up with the hard work and earn that Ph. D. You&#8217;re the best man for it, I know your dad would be proud.</p>

<p><strong>To my Brother: Here&#8217;s the speech that you deserve.</strong></p>

<p>Kelly, you&#8217;ve found a great guy. He may be somewhat standoffish and hardheaded but he truly does have a good heart. The two of you were lucky to find each other. Just don&#8217;t forget to support each other&#8217;s needs, wants and desires. You never know how much you&#8217;ll need one another until you don&#8217;t have that support net. Welcome to the family, Kelly.</p>

<p><em><strong>BTW:</strong> This is not the same speech I WILL be giving</em></p>

<p><strong>To the love of my life:</strong></p>

<p>Sarah, you&#8217;ve meant the world to me. Even though we&#8217;ve had our fights and arguments you&#8217;ve truly been the best. I&#8217;m so happy that I was able to have you in my life making me a better person. The only thing that I ask is that you stay in contact with all the friends that we&#8217;ve made over the years and become the doctor that you&#8217;ve wanted to be for so long. Try not to be so hard on yourself. You may think that you&#8217;ve failed every test, but I know better.</p>

<p>Just remember the times that we had, and thank you for always being my source of strength and support.</p>

<p><strong>To everyone else:</strong> Live your life to the fullest. No regrets and remember to never let life take control of you, you are the one in control.</p>

<p>Love always,</p>

<p>Greg</p>

I was enjoying a pleasant experience at a suburban men&amp;#8217;s clothing store the other day. My sales person, John was enthusiastically taking my money and I was excited about the clothing he had up-sold me. I only went in for a shirt…the alterations on my new sport coat and 2 pair of slacks would be ready in 2 days.
John was interrupted by another salesperson,&amp;#8221;He doesn’t want me to wait on him.</description>

<p>I was enjoying a pleasant experience at a suburban men&#8217;s clothing store the other day. My sales person, John was enthusiastically taking my money and I was excited about the clothing he had up-sold me. I only went in for a shirt…the alterations on my new sport coat and 2 pair of slacks would be ready in 2 days.</p>

<p>John was interrupted by another salesperson,&#8221;He doesn’t want me to wait on him. &#8220;John said, &#8220;What?&#8221; and was answered, &#8220;He wants his own kind.&#8221; John stopped and looked at the other employee and said, &#8220;Excuse me?&#8221; The employee repeated, &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t want me to help him.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is 2011. I&#8217;m shopping in a nice, suburban neighborhood, retail outlet. The customer refusing help is a clean-cut, well-groomed, professional-looking, 30 something. Is this for real?</p>

<p>With clenched jaw, John went to the stores manager. The manager helped the customer.</p>

<p>The employee who had been refused was a 70-year-old retired military man. He fought for our country and defended us all.</p>

<p>If you Google &#8220;Hate Groups,&#8221; there are over 900 hate groups listed. Should we start a dexteresque hate group–a hate group that hates hate groups? Well&#8230;no. It’s a reminder that racism continues to exist. It can be anywhere and is everywhere. It is the responsibility of people to work against it, and it starts with our children. Do not assume they know what is right – teach them, and show them.</p>

<p>When I was 13-years old, my parents owned and operated a neighborhood convenience store. A small cafeteria was attached to the store. Mom ran the cafeteria and dad ran the store.</p>

<p>The cafeteria did a lively lunch business supported by a few local businesses. One warm summer day, a local power company service crew stopped to eat. One member of the service crew was an African American (back then, he was black). Several regulars from a local gravel operation began heckling the man, &#8220;You know where the colored section is? It&#8217;s out in your damn truck you ___!” The heckling became worse. My dad took off his white store apron, handed it to me, and asked me to run the register. He was going to lunch. My dad went through the line, got a tray of food and sat down with the African American man. It was a lesson. The cafeteria closed a short time later. It had been black- balled. Over the years, my dad taught me we all have prejudices, but must understand they are wrong and work to change them. Teach your children.</p>

            <description>So as I&amp;#8217;m progressing through my 20s I&amp;#8217;ve realized that I&amp;#8217;m no where near where I need to be in regards to my health. It&amp;#8217;s always a shock as to how I&amp;#8217;ve been able to get these last 4 to 5 years without realizing what I need to do sooner.
I&amp;#8217;m writing this post as a reminder to myself and to also have others help me stay accountable for my workouts.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So as I&#8217;m progressing through my 20s I&#8217;ve realized that I&#8217;m no where near where I need to be in regards to my health. It&#8217;s always a shock as to how I&#8217;ve been able to get these last 4 to 5 years without realizing what I need to do sooner.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m writing this post as a reminder to myself and to also have others help me stay accountable for my workouts. I really want to welcome friends that live in the Indianapolis area to join me, Randy Clark is already trying to setup some basketball shoot around times at Unique&#8217;s gym and I have the Red Devil Aquatics Club swimmers trying to get me to join the summer league team.</p>

<p>However the most important goal right now is to run in the Cincinnati Reds&#8217; <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/cin/community/race.jsp" target="_blank">Redleg Run</a> on June 11, 2011. Sarah is motivating (making) me so that we can complete both the 10k and 5k that morning. I&#8217;ve gotten through 3 miles and plan on continuing on a 12 week training plan to build my endurance for these races.</p>

<p>My final plan is to start eating healthier so that I can avoid the health issues that are currently plaguing my family including High Blood Pressure, Heart Disease and Diabetes.</p>

<p>I look forward to sharing my runs on Twitter and Facebook with my iPod Nano and Nike+ System so that I can (again) have people help me stay accountable. I apologize if this annoys some people, but at least I can be honest about my workouts when the system syncs up.</p>

<p>Well, here goes nothing!</p>

            <description>Now, to start things off I&amp;#8217;m a little upset and frustrated at this quote from Cam Newton after the Auburn Tigers beat the Oregon Ducks in the BCS Title game. So if this seems a little off topic, I want to apologize.
 &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t want nobody to feel sorry for me, because throughout this year didn&amp;#8217;t nobody feel sorry for Auburn,&amp;#8221; Newton said, setting a BCS record for double negatives in a single sentence.</description>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want nobody to feel sorry for me, because throughout this year didn&#8217;t nobody feel sorry for Auburn,&#8221; Newton said, setting a BCS record for double negatives in a single sentence. &#8220;We got the last laugh.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From an <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/bowls10/columns/story?columnist=forde_pat&amp;id=6010545" target="_blank">ESPN Article Here</a>.</p>

<p>The issue that I have with this is that Americans have gotten to a point where playing a sport has taken over from the Academic side of being a student-athlete. Please make a note that STUDENT comes first which means (to me) that you need to earn the right as a STUDENT to be an athlete at any level. This is also reinforced in the NFHS Coaches Certification required for non-Teaching coaches.</p>

<p>Now, I know I&#8217;m a first year coach and I may not have all the tips, techniques and other skills necessary, but I do know that in our swimming program we don&#8217;t tolerate people who slack off in the following aspects.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Discipline:</strong> Our athletes are to respect the coaching staff AND each other. While also having enough common sense to know when something has gone/is going awry.</li>
<li><strong>Academics:</strong> The school and the IHSAA hold our Student-Athletes accountable to have at least a 2.0 GPA and passing a minimum of 5 classes to take part in sports. We encourage a 3.0, anything less you seek tutoring.</li>
<li><strong>Training:</strong> We hold our students accountable to not miss training due to the limited amount of time we have. Missed training time is made up.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, I know that these types of things seem like common sense, but it makes for better athletes <strong>and</strong> better students. If we, as coaches, can hold our athletes accountable for withholding these simple things, we can also plan on them for holding themselves accountable later in life.</p>

<p>As always, feel free to express your opinions, whether they are similar or different. Everyone is welcome here.</p>

            <description>I&amp;#8217;m sitting on the bus on our way to Lawrence Central (and due to recent events the coaching staff needs to stagger their seating). I&amp;#8217;m in the back of the bus with all the &amp;#8220;close&amp;#8221; swimmers you can really see the camaraderie between the team.
At the same time you can also feel the sense of disconnect between swimmers of different backgrounds. Both of our team captains are sitting in the back minding themselves while the younger and less experienced swimmers sit quietly on their own.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m sitting on the bus on our way to Lawrence Central (and due to recent events the coaching staff needs to stagger their seating). I&#8217;m in the back of the bus with all the &#8220;close&#8221; swimmers you can really see the camaraderie between the team.</p>

<p>At the same time you can also feel the sense of disconnect between swimmers of different backgrounds. Both of our team captains are sitting in the back minding themselves while the younger and less experienced swimmers sit quietly on their own.</p>

<p>Hopefully by the end of the season we can make connections between the swimmers; especially the guys and girls. At the girls only meet they were laughing and having a good time. Today, we have limited interaction. Probably because the two teams cannot inter mix on the bus ride.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s the best way to promote team growth?</p>

            <description>I&amp;#8217;m starting to find myself in some tough spots. Last week we had a few guys that were having a rough time even making it through pushing off of a wall without stopping immediately. This combined with the fact that we have a 6-lane pool with over 30 swimmers meant that we unfortunately had to make some cuts.
Now for a business example. We (at @UniqueHomeSol) recently setup a marketing group to head up our online, TV and print campaigns.</description>

Last week we had a few guys that were having a rough time even making it through pushing off of a wall without stopping immediately. This combined with the fact that we have a 6-lane pool with over 30 swimmers meant that we unfortunately had to make some cuts.</p>

<p>Now for a business example. We (at @UniqueHomeSol) recently setup a marketing group to head up our online, TV and print campaigns. After about a week I was approached and told that if I didn&#8217;t &#8220;provide direction to the group&#8221; I would be done. Fortunately I was able to warm up to the idea of pushing ideas out into the room and developed the capacity to accept praise and criticism.</p>

<p>It seems like everyday we find ourselves in situations were we have to make cuts and sacrifices for the greater good of our company and teams. My question to you is how long does it take? Does everyone get the same chance, or do certain people get special treatment because of a relationship that they have with the owner or coach?</p>

<p>Ultimately, when is it appropriate to tell someone that feel like &#8216;they&#8217; are no longer an asset to your team? I&#8217;m thoroughly interested in your thoughts so please share them.</p>

<p>Recently, over lunch, Greg asked if I would guest post about separating work and Life. As I considered what I would like to share, I realized how many different approaches were available on this subject. Do I talk of social media and how difficult it is to separate work from social media <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>? How about strategies to balance your life? How to make work fun or eliminate stress? I could talk about balancing work, family, spiritual, and personal time. Should I explore employee and employer responsibilities?</p>

<p>I once took a position working fewer hours and making less income. I did this to put my life in balance. But there was a larger consideration. Although I believed in the ethics, mission, and vision of the organization, I was no longer passionate about my responsibilities within the organization. It was a disservice to the company and myself to stay. It was not my happy place. Should we expect work to make us happy? Can we make work a happy place?</p>

<p>During the industrial revolution when it was not uncommon to work sun up to sun down, 6-7 days a week, in poor, unsafe, and unhealthy working conditions, it was thought by many thinkers of the day that “free” time would make people happier. This is not always the case.</p>

<p>In our society it is a commonly held belief that money makes us happy. Yes, I know we give lip service to the ideal that money can’t bring happiness, but lets look at actions not words. Would you consider a significant cut in pay to be happy? Could you afford to?</p>

<p>So what does make us happy? Passion. Believing in what we are doing, in and out of work. Being part of a team. Having others we can talk to and count on. Knowing “this” (whatever this is) is important. How is this accomplished?</p>

<h2 id="make-your-passion-your-work">Make your passion your work…</h2>

<p>What do you love? How can you be paid to do what you love? Who is paid to do what you love? Brad Stevens, the Butler basketball coach, left a lucrative position with Eli Lilly’s to be coordinator of basketball operations; I believe this was an unpaid position. You may have to start small, part time, on the side, or for less money.</p>

<h2 id="or-be-passionate-about-your-work">…or be passionate about your work</h2>

<ul>
<li>Do your best at whatever you do, earn that wonderful feeling of accomplishment</li>
<li>Act with passion, spread positive energy</li>
<li>Bring or support innovation, creativity, and originally to projects</li>
<li>Refresh &#8211; take breaks, gear back up</li>
<li>Learn something new &#8211; take a class, study on line or go to a seminar.</li>
<li>Engage others &#8211; be an advocate</li>
<li>Understand the vision, mission, and direction of the organization</li>
<li>Speak your mind, politely, but with passion and truth.</li>
</ul>

<p>This post is probably not what Greg had in mind. It really is not about how to separate work from life. It is how to be happier by making work a fulfilling, happy part of your life, not just a paycheck. Are you happy at work, why or why not?</p>

            <description>While you are in school, no one really tells you how to prepare for work life. Honestly, I wasn&amp;#8217;t sure I could make it in the real world. However, I&amp;#8217;m currently working a full time job, paid off 2 student loans (2 to go), picked up my cell phone bill and bought a car! The best part is that I&amp;#8217;m only 23 years old.
No one can prepare you for the real world better than yourself!</description>

<p>While you are in school, no one really tells you how to prepare for work life. Honestly, I wasn&#8217;t sure I could make it in the real world. However, I&#8217;m currently working a full time job, paid off 2 student loans (2 to go), picked up my cell phone bill and bought a car! The best part is that I&#8217;m only 23 years old.</p>

<p>No one can prepare you for the real world better than yourself! You have to know what will work for you and what won&#8217;t.</p>

<h2 id="consistency-is-key">Consistency is Key</h2>

<p>A lot of college students think that they are clever by taking classes that start after 10 or 11 every day. But in all honesty how many jobs are there where you are going to be able to come in at those times? My first year of college I didn&#8217;t have the luxury of picking late classes, but I was also supposed to be up at 5 everyday for swimming practice.</p>

<p>Getting your day started at the same time everyday will help prepare you for working everyday. Make sure that you wake up with plenty of time to get ready and eat. After a night of fasting you&#8217;ll need the energy to make it through the rest of the day.</p>

<p>The other aspect that is often overlooked are the &#8220;overnighters&#8221; and late nights out. Now, I understand the desire to want to go out with friends or (in my case) playing video games all night. But making sure that you get into a regular sleeping habit is just as important.</p>

<h2 id="make-time-for-work-8230">Make Time for Work&#8230;</h2>

<p>Doing your work in school or while on the job is important, however, you should also know when to stop. People that I work with seem to lose a bit of separation between the two. I&#8217;ve worked with people that try to get by with doing minimum work and those that work 12-16 hours a day (including my own parents).</p>

<p>You need to find what works best for you. While I was in my last year of school I took 22 and 23 credit hours and worked about 15 hours a week. Fortunately I was able to fit everything I needed to get into my day between the hours of 8 and 6. After 6:00 (aside from my night class or class projects) I didn&#8217;t do any work. I took some time for myself and my friends.</p>

<h2 id="8230-and-your-friends">&#8230;And Your Friends</h2>

<p>Making time for friends is something most college students don&#8217;t have a problem with, but I have noticed it as a problem between people starting their careers. You don&#8217;t have the privilege of going out every night like you did in college and it then seems like you aren&#8217;t MAKING time for your friends anymore.</p>

<p>Everyone needs to just take a step back from work and enjoy your time off. Get away for the weekends, go out to a bar or just to a movie or something. Don&#8217;t take life too seriously, no one gets out alive.</p>

<h2 id="take-work-seriously-8230-but-don-8217-t-let-it-consume-you">Take Work Seriously&#8230;but don&#8217;t let it consume you</h2>

<p>In the next part of this post Randy Clark (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/RandyLyleClark" target="_blank">@randyclarktko</a>) will talk about being happy with your work life. Which includes certain sacrifices that you might have to make if you aren&#8217;t happy in your current situation.</p>

<p>To me, work isn&#8217;t my life I just do it to make sure that I can live. That&#8217;s my philosophy so what&#8217;s yours? How did your transition from school to work go? And more importantly how were you able to manage your time?</p>

            <description>I know that when I started looking for jobs in college I looked for just about any place that was offering a job. The worst part about it was looking for something within my Degree (BSBA in Business Management). Obviously trying to find a &amp;#8220;management&amp;#8221; job was out of the question unless it would be lower-level.
Target your Ideal Job The best advice that I can even begin to give to Juniors and Seniors looking for a permanent job is to target the type of job that you want not just what you pre-qualify yourself for.</description>

<p>I know that when I started looking for jobs in college I looked for just about any place that was offering a job. The worst part about it was looking for something within my Degree (BSBA in Business Management). Obviously trying to find a &#8220;management&#8221; job was out of the question unless it would be lower-level.</p>

<h2 id="target-your-ideal-job">Target your Ideal Job</h2>

<p>The best advice that I can even begin to give to Juniors and Seniors looking for a permanent job is to target the type of job that you <strong>want</strong> not just what you pre-qualify yourself for. Just because you got a History degree doesn&#8217;t mean you have to become a historian, you can also work wherever you want.</p>

<h2 id="use-your-school-8217-s-reputation">Use your School&#8217;s Reputation</h2>

<p>One thing that the school is going to push is using the name. I went to Xavier University and they said it has great pull all over the country. Even better, I was in the Williams College of Business which had pull with P&amp;G. Guess what&#8230;I&#8217;m not at P&amp;G. However, there are ties with all sorts of alumni because people hire people. Networking is the best way to find a job. You can do it through many means, your school, LinkedIn, Facebook or Twitter.</p>

<p>You need to make sure you are yourself, and professional.</p>

<h2 id="send-our-your-resume">Send our your Resume</h2>

<p>Develop and design your résumé to fit your personality. Don&#8217;t have it be so rigid or use the built-in Mac/Microsoft templates. Customize it to an extent, while still having a professional feel to it. Personalized touches could differentiate you from your competition, however, it could also turn off certain people if they typically see a particular format. Make sure you exercise caution!</p>

<p>Also plan on using resume paper instead of plain printer paper. Again, subtle touches could differentiate  you from someone else.</p>

<h2 id="the-interview">The Interview</h2>

<p>This is the toughest part of the job hunt since many things going on. In a phone interview the best thing to do is sit down with your résumé, paper and pen and relax. There&#8217;s no need for nerves. Make sure that you are ready to answer and ASK questions.</p>

<p>Do well here and you&#8217;re on your way to a face to face interview.</p>

<h3 id="dress-for-the-job-you-want-not-the-one-you-have">Dress for the Job you Want; Not the one you have</h3>

<p>Every business has a dress code policy. Make sure that you are familiar with that before you pick out your attire for the interview! However, there are a few simple rules to follow:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you want to become a lawyer, put on your best suit. A polo and slacks should suffice for a coaching interview. There&#8217;s no need to over dress when going in for that interview, but make sure that you portray the positive person you are. You need to show a sense of realism and confidence, and knowing who you are and what you want to do definitely helps!</li>
<li>Groom! Brush your teeth, comb or cut your hair, and make sure your hair looks appropriate (heading to an interview like you just got out of bed is not something you want to do).</li>
<li>Differentiate yourself from the crowd! You don&#8217;t want to wear the same Black Suit, White Shirt, Red Tie that everyone wears. Feel free to venture out (I interviewed with a Purple Shirt and Tie once; that Bank was not amused, others loved it)</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t be afraid to talk highly of yourself. You have to let the person get to know you, good and bad! However, if saying something about a bad thing that happened make sure to say what you took away from the experience. (Ex: I started developing this website and it didn&#8217;t take off like I thought. However, I learned that proper strategic planning and advertising pays off.)</li>
<li>Finally, be yourself! <strong>People hire people</strong> you don&#8217;t need to throw out every marketing buzzword but make sure you are giving an accurate description of who you are and what you know!</li>
</ul>

<p>If you see anything that I missed or you want to add something please feel free to add it via a comment below.</p>

            <description>This weekend I decided to head down to visit my girlfriend, who is attending IU Medical School, and while we know that living an hour apart is going to be tough we never realized how hard it was until today around 2:00.
She and I have been together for the last five years and honestly we&amp;#8217;ve both been rather selfish with doing what we want instead of really thinking about one another.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This weekend I decided to head down to visit my girlfriend, who is attending IU Medical School, and while we know that living an hour apart is going to be tough we never realized how hard it was until today around 2:00.</p>

<p>She and I have been together for the last five years and honestly we&#8217;ve both been rather selfish with doing what we want instead of really thinking about one another. She wants to be a doctor, and I have no idea where my life is taking me. Right now I work in a fast paced environment working with Social Media, Websites and doing Technical Support for the Home Improvement Biz. However, I know that my heart&#8217;s not in it and I&#8217;m doing it really for the week to week paycheck. That&#8217;s why I recently picked up a job at Pike High School as an assistant swim coach.</p>

<p>This coaching job is more in target for what I want to do. The difficult thing that I&#8217;ll have to deal with is not being able to come home right after work, instead I&#8217;ll have to deal with going from work to practice, then finally home. I know it&#8217;s going to be time consuming, but I&#8217;m hoping that it&#8217;ll keep me entertained and active. I&#8217;m ready to do what I want to do, instead of what everyone is telling me I&#8217;m good at.</p>

<p>Sometimes you have to be willing to settle for what you can get. But once you realize what you really want to do make sure you chase after it. Give yourself a time line to achieve your goals just make sure it&#8217;s realistic. Start your business, go get a different degree or whatever, just know when it&#8217;s a wash. However, &#8220;if at first you don&#8217;t succeed. Try, try again.&#8221;</p>

            <description>I&amp;#8217;m sure that you&amp;#8217;ve heard the old phrase &amp;#8220;Don&amp;#8217;t Judge a book by it&amp;#8217;s cover&amp;#8221; but is that really how we operate? I know that I am guilty of judging someone based on their looks.
When we are looking for something or someone we look at links, videos, and images. What I want to talk about is your personal appearance, particularly in your online avatar. If you were to show up to an interview in a pair of ripped jeans, a dirty polo and basketball shoes would you be received the same as if you were to show up wearing a professionally cleaned and tailored suit?</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m sure that you&#8217;ve heard the old phrase &#8220;Don&#8217;t Judge a book by it&#8217;s cover&#8221; but is that really how we operate? I know that I am guilty of judging someone based on their looks.</p>

<p>When we are looking for something or someone we look at links, videos, and images. What I want to talk about is your personal appearance, particularly in your online avatar. If you were to show up to an interview in a pair of ripped jeans, a dirty polo and basketball shoes would you be received the same as if you were to show up wearing a professionally cleaned and tailored suit? I think not!</p>

<p>The same goes for your online appearance. You <strong>cannot</strong> expect to be taken serious as an 18-year old at a party with a beer in your hand. Marketing yourself starts with your initial appearance. This doesn&#8217;t mean that you have to go out and have a professional head shot done (however <a href="http://www.twitter.com/mooshinindy" target="_blank">@mooshinindy</a> or <a href="http://www.twitter.com/joshhumble" target="_blank">@joshhumble</a> could help you there). You just need to make sure that you are portraying yourself in a manner that is not detrimental to those judging you solely based on your cover.</p>

<p>As was stated by Casey Mullins (@mooshinindy) at the @BlogIndiana Conference &#8220;Find three words that describe you and have your avatar represent those three things.&#8221;</p>

<p>One last thing to remember, you can never get a second first impression.</p>

<p>You can also find me on Twitter, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/mcmullen_greg" target="_blank">@mcmullen_greg</a></p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> If you are looking for a place for a &#8220;Global Avatar&#8221; (usable on most WordPress Websites) go to <a href="http://en.gravatar.com/" target="_blank">http://en.gravatar.com/</a>. Your Email Address helps to identify who you are and displays the correct avatar of your choosing.</p>

            <description>Hey,
It is hard to try and find some internet in Ireland. But we have some access today and it&amp;#8217;s expensive so this will be short.
 Castles? Amazing! Ireland? Amazing! Staying in a Castle? Friggin&amp;rsquo; sweet! By the end of the trip I will have seen the coast more here than in the US  That is all,
Leave some comments if you can!</description>

            <description>Hello everybody! Just so everyone knows I made it to Ireland safe and sound. The flight was long, and very boring and also very uncomfortable. However, I did realize that Shannon International has FREE WI-FI, hence the reason I am writing right now. So after I get out of the airport I should be able to do some visiting of the area and being able to enjoy my self in the land of my forefathers.</description>

            <description>One more week to go until the venture over to Ireland. I&amp;#8217;m starting to get excited and nervous all at the same time. I&amp;#8217;ve finally started my homework that is supposed to be turned in before I leave, but it&amp;#8217;s hard to actually get the motivation to do it. One assignment is done, but now I need to find a way to get the book read and answer the questions.</description>

            <description>Well,
To start off I just want to say that this will be an interesting trip. If anyone wants to know what I am planning on doing throughout the trip there is a link to the website that has some of the information on it.
I will be attending a second round of &amp;#8220;Ireland trippers&amp;#8221; and will be taking a Sociology class and a Biology class (which Sarah is jealous of) that involves a lot of nature walks, as well as bird watching.</description>

<p>To start off I just want to say that this will be an interesting trip. If anyone wants to know what I am planning on doing throughout the trip there is a <a href="http://www.thegreenpicnic.com/Studenttours.html" target="_blank">link to the website</a> that has some of the information on it.</p>

<p>I will be attending a second round of &#8220;Ireland trippers&#8221; and will be taking a Sociology class and a Biology class (which Sarah is jealous of) that involves a lot of nature walks, as well as bird watching. Throughout the trip we will be visiting various aspects of traditional Ireland, including farm houses (where we will get an amazing dinner), castles (jealous much?) and beach scenery. Now I know what you are thinking. &#8220;Beaches in Ireland???&#8221; Yes, there are beaches in Ireland, however it is only going to be about 60 degrees in the water so we are NOT going swimming.</p>

<p>Alright, well as far as a first post I&#8217;d say that this pretty much covers it. Hope you enjoy your summer, cuz I know I will enjoy those two weeks!!!!!!!</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all for now,</p>

<p>Greg</p>
