<p><strong>Author:</strong> <a href="https://www.twitter.com/RandyLyleClark" target="_blank">Randy Clark</a></p>

<p>Recently, over lunch, Greg asked if I would guest post about separating work and Life. As I considered what I would like to share, I realized how many different approaches were available on this subject. Do I talk of social media and how difficult it is to separate work from social media <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>? How about strategies to balance your life? How to make work fun or eliminate stress? I could talk about balancing work, family, spiritual, and personal time. Should I explore employee and employer responsibilities?</p>

<p>I once took a position working fewer hours and making less income. I did this to put my life in balance. But there was a larger consideration. Although I believed in the ethics, mission, and vision of the organization, I was no longer passionate about my responsibilities within the organization. It was a disservice to the company and myself to stay. It was not my happy place. Should we expect work to make us happy? Can we make work a happy place?</p>

<p>During the industrial revolution when it was not uncommon to work sun up to sun down, 6-7 days a week, in poor, unsafe, and unhealthy working conditions, it was thought by many thinkers of the day that “free” time would make people happier. This is not always the case.</p>

<p>In our society it is a commonly held belief that money makes us happy. Yes, I know we give lip service to the ideal that money can’t bring happiness, but lets look at actions not words. Would you consider a significant cut in pay to be happy? Could you afford to?</p>

<p>So what does make us happy? Passion. Believing in what we are doing, in and out of work. Being part of a team. Having others we can talk to and count on. Knowing “this” (whatever this is) is important. How is this accomplished?</p>

<h2 id="make-your-passion-your-work">Make your passion your work…</h2>

<p>What do you love? How can you be paid to do what you love? Who is paid to do what you love? Brad Stevens, the Butler basketball coach, left a lucrative position with Eli Lilly’s to be coordinator of basketball operations; I believe this was an unpaid position. You may have to start small, part time, on the side, or for less money.</p>

<h2 id="or-be-passionate-about-your-work">…or be passionate about your work</h2>

<ul>
<li>Do your best at whatever you do, earn that wonderful feeling of accomplishment</li>
<li>Act with passion, spread positive energy</li>
<li>Bring or support innovation, creativity, and originally to projects</li>
<li>Refresh &#8211; take breaks, gear back up</li>
<li>Learn something new &#8211; take a class, study on line or go to a seminar.</li>
<li>Engage others &#8211; be an advocate</li>
<li>Understand the vision, mission, and direction of the organization</li>
<li>Speak your mind, politely, but with passion and truth.</li>
</ul>

<p>This post is probably not what Greg had in mind. It really is not about how to separate work from life. It is how to be happier by making work a fulfilling, happy part of your life, not just a paycheck. Are you happy at work, why or why not?</p>
