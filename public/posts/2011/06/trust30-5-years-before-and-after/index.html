<p>What would you say to the person you were five years ago? What will you say to the person you’ll be in five years?</p>

<hr />

<p>Five years ago, I was in transition between the University of Evansville and Xavier University. The year was disappointing to me. First, I was over three hours away from the love of my life. Second, I failed to finish the first year of my collegiate swimming career. Finally, I completely messed up my back due to a weight lifting incident.</p>

<h3 id="what-would-i-tell-myself-from-five-years-ago">What would I tell myself from five years ago?</h3>

<p>Stay at UE! You went here because you had a chance to continue your swimming career. When we visited you fell in love with the campus and you will get a great education too. While the doctors said that your back would never be the same, you can adjust to it and will quickly.</p>

<p>Life will never be easy, but you don&#8217;t want to take the easy road. Continue on with your education until you feel like you are in a good spot to obtain the career of your dreams. Don&#8217;t forget to thank your friends and family for their support and love.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-five-years-from-now">What about five years from now?</h3>

<p>Hmm. This one is tougher since I&#8217;m not entirely sure where I&#8217;ll be in five years. The first thing I would say is &#8220;thanks.&#8221; Thanks for making it this far and (hopefully) congratulations on whatever accomplishments I&#8217;ve made.</p>

<p>The last thing I would say is, &#8220;keep moving on, and don’t stop working towards your dreams. Always be there for your family and support their dreams as well. Don&#8217;t give up on what you believe in.&#8221;</p>

<p>So&#8230;now it&#8217;s your turn. How would you approach yourself five years ago? In five years?</p>
