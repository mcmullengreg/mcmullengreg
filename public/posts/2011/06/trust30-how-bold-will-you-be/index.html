<p>Next to Resistance, rational thought is the artist or entrepreneurs worst enemy. Bad things happen when we employ rational thought, because rational thought comes from the ego. Instead, we want to work from the Self, that is, from instinct and intuition, from the unconscious.</p>

<p>A child has no trouble believing the unbelievable, nor does the genius or the madman. Its only you and I, with our big brains and our tiny hearts, who doubt and overthink and hesitate.” &#8211; Steven Pressfield, Do the Work</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The idea of “being realistic” holds all of us back. From starting a business or quitting a job to dating someone who may not be our type or moving to a new place – getting “real” often means putting your dreams on hold.</p>

<p>Today, let’s take a step away from rational thought and dare to be bold. What’s one thing you’ve always wanted to accomplish but have been afraid to pursue? Write it down. Also write down the obstacles in your way of reaching your goal. Finally, write down a tangible plan to overcome each obstacle.</p>

<p>The only thing left is to, you know, actually go make it happen. What are you waiting for?</p>

<hr />

<p>In my last post, I talked about how I don&#8217;t regret the way that my life has gone. While that is true, I still have room for improvement. There&#8217;s one thing that is immediately coming to mind about being <em>rational</em> with my life. My job.</p>

<p>Sarah and I have talked about going down the path of me quitting, going back to school (or not) and pursuing my coaching career AS a career. However, through our talks we have since realized it&#8217;s not feasible since it currently will not pay enough to cover the costs of living.</p>

<h2 id="obstacles-8230">Obstacles&#8230;</h2>

<p>There are three areas that are currently in the way of getting my <a href="http://www.gregoryamcmullen.com/posts/2010/08/chasing-your-dream-job">dream job</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Experience</strong>

<ul>
<li>Companies of all industries aren&#8217;t willing to risk paying an inexperienced employee. Why? I don&#8217;t know. Aren&#8217;t there enough examples of young guns that have been very successful? Does the name Brad Stevens ring a bell? Butler could have hired a well versed coach, but did they? No.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Uncertainty of a Livable Wage</strong>

<ul>
<li>This scares me the most of all. I know what I&#8217;ve been paid for a typical High School Swim Season and I also know that athletic and art funds have been cut. How can I justify quitting my job when I don&#8217;t know if I can get a full time job? Maybe I should ask Brad Stevens&#8230;</li>
<li>I have no other income to fall back on. Sarah and I have talked about me taking this path. The only problem, she is still a student. Med Student = Limited or No Income + Loans</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Lack of Full Support</strong></li>
<li>Sarah encouraged me to pursue the High School Coaching job but has also talked me into keeping my current Full Time employment, which I am extremely thankful for. The only reason I don&#8217;t have full support is because I have yet to talk to other people about it and that is all on me.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="overcoming-the-obstacles-8230">Overcoming the Obstacles&#8230;</h2>

<p><strong>Experience:</strong> Be thankful that the Red Devil Aquatics Club and Pike High School have offered me the current position that I have. Continue working on developing my coaching skills. Possibly get more experience from picking up extra coaching time with the Middle School and Club programs.</p>

<p><strong>Wages:</strong> Continue working with my current employer, whom gives me flexible hours to pursue this dream, to get off work early and have the extra weekend time off to coach and mentor the kids. Do everything in my power and skill set to continue working full time and as a part time coach until I have someone to help me or enough saved up to live.</p>

<p><strong>Support:</strong> Talk to family and friends. Get their opinions and suggestions on how to approach and manage the career change and lifestyle. Work with previous coaches and find how they worked it out when times got rough.</p>

<p>I know my posts have been repetitive in talking about my dream job, but it&#8217;s something that I am very passionate about and I feel like I am holding myself back by not pursuing it more.</p>

<p>I appreciate anyone and everyone reading these posts and would welcome you to share your obstacles of what you are scared to pursue. So tell me, what are you afraid of?</p>
