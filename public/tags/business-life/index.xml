      <description>While you are in school, no one really tells you how to prepare for work life. Honestly, I wasn&amp;#8217;t sure I could make it in the real world. However, I&amp;#8217;m currently working a full time job, paid off 2 student loans (2 to go), picked up my cell phone bill and bought a car! The best part is that I&amp;#8217;m only 23 years old.
No one can prepare you for the real world better than yourself!</description>
