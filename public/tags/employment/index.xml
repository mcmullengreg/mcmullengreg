      <description>Recently I was talking to an online acquaintance regarding the process of making tough decisions. My question to you is why are you afraid to take the risks that will make you happy?
People are Safe You know what will make you happy don&amp;#8217;t you? So why aren&amp;#8217;t you doing everything you can to do it? I&amp;#8217;ve seen in my life that I need encouragement do try something different. When I saw the coaching position open I was hesitant to apply, why?</description>
