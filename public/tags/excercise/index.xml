      <description>Life wastes itself while we are preparing to live. – Ralph Waldo Emerson
 If you had one week left to live, would you still be doing what you’re doing now? In what areas of your life are you preparing to live? Take them off your To Do list and add them to a To Stop list. Resolve to only do what makes you come alive.
Bonus: How can your goals improve the present and not keep you in a perpetual “always something better” spiral?</description>

      <description>So as I&amp;#8217;m progressing through my 20s I&amp;#8217;ve realized that I&amp;#8217;m no where near where I need to be in regards to my health. It&amp;#8217;s always a shock as to how I&amp;#8217;ve been able to get these last 4 to 5 years without realizing what I need to do sooner.
I&amp;#8217;m writing this post as a reminder to myself and to also have others help me stay accountable for my workouts.</description>
