      <description>Now, to start things off I&amp;#8217;m a little upset and frustrated at this quote from Cam Newton after the Auburn Tigers beat the Oregon Ducks in the BCS Title game. So if this seems a little off topic, I want to apologize.
 &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t want nobody to feel sorry for me, because throughout this year didn&amp;#8217;t nobody feel sorry for Auburn,&amp;#8221; Newton said, setting a BCS record for double negatives in a single sentence.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m sitting on the bus on our way to Lawrence Central (and due to recent events the coaching staff needs to stagger their seating). I&amp;#8217;m in the back of the bus with all the &amp;#8220;close&amp;#8221; swimmers you can really see the camaraderie between the team.
At the same time you can also feel the sense of disconnect between swimmers of different backgrounds. Both of our team captains are sitting in the back minding themselves while the younger and less experienced swimmers sit quietly on their own.</description>
