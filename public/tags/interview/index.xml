      <description>I was recently interviewed for a head coach jobÂ at a swim club. I surprised myself when I was asked the question.
 What makes you different/better than the next person that we bring in?
 My response, &amp;#8220;Nothing.&amp;#8221;
What the @#$^% are you thinking? How am I supposed to know what makes me different from people I&amp;#8217;ve never met? For all I know they could be 30 years old and have coached for 15 years, am I better than them?</description>
