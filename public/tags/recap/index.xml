      <description>With my first collegiate season under my belt, I am definitely looking forward to my second year (and more, if possible).
We wrapped up the season with 20 individualÂ records (more with diving) and had two compete at the NCAA Division III National Championships.
Challenges Being a first-year (first-time collegiate) coach was intimidating. While I felt the need to approach the athletes different, I didn&amp;#8217;t. They were responsive to my critiques and criticisms, inviting the views from a coach they didn&amp;#8217;t know that well.</description>
