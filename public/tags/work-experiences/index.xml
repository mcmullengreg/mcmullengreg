      <description>For the last three weeks, I&amp;#8217;ve been working towards finding my own way. The people at Rose-Hulman have made my transition extremely easy and incredibly fun.
I&amp;#8217;ve been introduced to a large group of people and have already been given a large project that will change the way this school looks at social media. I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to getting it off the ground.
This new position I&amp;#8217;m in has been a very large change compared to where I was previously, they are embracing technology and putting the latest and greatest tools in front of me.</description>
