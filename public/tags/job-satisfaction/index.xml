Recently, over lunch, Greg asked if I would guest post about separating work and Life. As I considered what I would like to share, I realized how many different approaches were available on this subject. Do I talk of social media and how difficult it is to separate work from social media 24&amp;frasl;7? How about strategies to balance your life? How to make work fun or eliminate stress?</description>
