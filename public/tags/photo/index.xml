      <description>This image was captured while on vacation at Ft Myers Beach. Sarah and I were walking along the beach to this pier on our second to last morning and I decided to capture this as a Hand-Held HDR photo. All things considered, I really like the way it turned out. Not sure how I was able to capture the waves, but I&amp;#8217;m glad that I did.</description>

      <description>I did something out of the ordinary the other day. I saw something that caught my eye (and had my camera) and decided to stop on the side of the road and snap a photo.
It&amp;#8217;s a reminder to all of us to stop and take in the moments of our lives and find the best out of any situation.</description>
