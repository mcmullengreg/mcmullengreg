      <description>There are two Michael Jordan quotes that truly are amazing. Actually, he has quite a few quotes on this topic; the two I am going to focus on are some of my favorites.
 I&amp;#8217;ve missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I&amp;#8217;ve lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I&amp;#8217;ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I&amp;#8217;ve failed over and over and over again in my life.</description>
