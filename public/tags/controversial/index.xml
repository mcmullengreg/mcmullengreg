I was enjoying a pleasant experience at a suburban men&amp;#8217;s clothing store the other day. My sales person, John was enthusiastically taking my money and I was excited about the clothing he had up-sold me. I only went in for a shirt…the alterations on my new sport coat and 2 pair of slacks would be ready in 2 days.
John was interrupted by another salesperson,&amp;#8221;He doesn’t want me to wait on him.</description>
