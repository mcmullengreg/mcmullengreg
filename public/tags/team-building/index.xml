      <description>The 2013-2014 season at Rose-Hulman ended better than I ever could have imagined. After breaking more than 20 records in the 2012-2013 season, I never would have imagined breaking another 13. We sent two to the NCAA Division III National Championships.
Both swam well and earned All-American status by finishing in the top 8.
Personal Challenges This season was easier than last year.
From my point of view, I had a very successful season.</description>

      <description>Now, to start things off I&amp;#8217;m a little upset and frustrated at this quote from Cam Newton after the Auburn Tigers beat the Oregon Ducks in the BCS Title game. So if this seems a little off topic, I want to apologize.
 &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t want nobody to feel sorry for me, because throughout this year didn&amp;#8217;t nobody feel sorry for Auburn,&amp;#8221; Newton said, setting a BCS record for double negatives in a single sentence.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m sitting on the bus on our way to Lawrence Central (and due to recent events the coaching staff needs to stagger their seating). I&amp;#8217;m in the back of the bus with all the &amp;#8220;close&amp;#8221; swimmers you can really see the camaraderie between the team.
At the same time you can also feel the sense of disconnect between swimmers of different backgrounds. Both of our team captains are sitting in the back minding themselves while the younger and less experienced swimmers sit quietly on their own.</description>
