      <description>If you&amp;#8217;ve ever watched a college basketball game, the coaching staff in the locker room is trying to &amp;#8220;psych&amp;#8221; up the team. Sometimes it works; however, it also creates undue stress in what could be your top performers.
Motivation isn&amp;#8217;t taught. It&amp;#8217;s also something that a coach or parent isn&amp;#8217;t in control of. Allowing an athlete the ability to stay relaxed in a familiar environment is more motivating than anything a coach or parent can say.</description>
