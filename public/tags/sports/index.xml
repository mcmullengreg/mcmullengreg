      <description>The 2013-2014 season at Rose-Hulman ended better than I ever could have imagined. After breaking more than 20 records in the 2012-2013 season, I never would have imagined breaking another 13. We sent two to the NCAA Division III National Championships.
Both swam well and earned All-American status by finishing in the top 8.
Personal Challenges This season was easier than last year.
From my point of view, I had a very successful season.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;#8217;ve ever watched a college basketball game, the coaching staff in the locker room is trying to &amp;#8220;psych&amp;#8221; up the team. Sometimes it works; however, it also creates undue stress in what could be your top performers.
Motivation isn&amp;#8217;t taught. It&amp;#8217;s also something that a coach or parent isn&amp;#8217;t in control of. Allowing an athlete the ability to stay relaxed in a familiar environment is more motivating than anything a coach or parent can say.</description>
