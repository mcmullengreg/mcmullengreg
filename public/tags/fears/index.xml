      <description>Job searching is a necessary part of your professional life. However, there are some do&amp;#8217;s and don&amp;#8217;ts. Right now I&amp;#8217;m going to talk about something that hits very close to home when it comes to searching for your next job or even your dream career.
While the title of this post hints at what not to do I also want to touch on a few things that you should do.</description>

      <description>The other terror that scares us from self-trust is our consistency; a reverence for our past act or word, because the eyes of others have no other data for computing our orbit than our past acts, and we are loath to disappoint them. &amp;#8211; Ralph Waldo Emerson
Emerson says: “Always do what you are afraid to do.” What is ‘too scary’ to write about? Try doing it now.
So I wasn&amp;#8217;t really sure about what to write on this prompt.</description>

      <description>Our arts, our occupations, our marriages, our religion, we have not chosen, but society has chosen for us. We are parlour soldiers. We shun the rugged battle of fate, where strength is born. – Ralph Waldo Emerson
 Next to Resistance, rational thought is the artist or entrepreneurs worst enemy. Bad things happen when we employ rational thought, because rational thought comes from the ego. Instead, we want to work from the Self, that is, from instinct and intuition, from the unconscious.</description>
