      <description>Over the weekend, a friend asked me to do something I&amp;#8217;ve never done before. Photograph their wedding.
While I wasn&amp;#8217;t the official photographer, I was askedÂ to take one of the last photos of the night. The one posted below. I have never done photos like this and was impressed with my results. I have done zero post work (yet) and am looking for tips/tricks/advice on post work and general thoughts of how it turned out.</description>
