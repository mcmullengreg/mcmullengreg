      <description>Everyone&amp;#8217;s busy. How do you manage to get a workout in? Do you have an expensive gym membership? Do you just walk or run around your neighborhood? Or do you have trouble finding the motivation to do a workout?
Today, I&amp;#8217;m going to give you just a few simple workout ideas using nothing but a resistance band, AKA Stretch Cords.
Resistance bands come in different lengths and resistance levels. The nice thing about using resistance bands is that you don&amp;#8217;t have to worry about dropping something heavy on your foot, so this makes for a nice workout even when you are alone.</description>

      <description>So as I&amp;#8217;m progressing through my 20s I&amp;#8217;ve realized that I&amp;#8217;m no where near where I need to be in regards to my health. It&amp;#8217;s always a shock as to how I&amp;#8217;ve been able to get these last 4 to 5 years without realizing what I need to do sooner.
I&amp;#8217;m writing this post as a reminder to myself and to also have others help me stay accountable for my workouts.</description>
