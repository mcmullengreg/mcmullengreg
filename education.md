Late 2014, after beginning work at Xavier University, Greg heard rumblings that a new program would be starting up and would be looking for new students. This program was the Master of Education in Coaching Education and Athlete development, try saying that five times fast. Greg has spent some time on the pool deck coaching athletes ranging from first-timers to NCAA All-Americans. He knew this would be a great way to study something he is passionate about.

Greg decided he would give it a go. 

In March 2015, he took the Miller Analogies Test (MAT) and was accepted into the program. While he was slated to start in the summer of 2015, the program did not have enough interest to begin the second cohort. Dr. Ron Quinn gave Greg the opportunity to join the first cohort and make up missed coursework beginning in January 2016.

The [Master of Education in Coaching Education and Athlete Development](http://www.xavier.edu/coaching) focuses on the following areas:

1. Coaching Pedagogy
2. Long-term Athlete Development
3. Character Development

Prior to his graduate coursework, Greg graduated from Xavier University's Williams College of Business with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration in 2009.
