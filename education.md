While working at Xavier, Greg heard a new program was looking for students. The Master of Education in Coaching Education and Athlete development. He knew this would be a great way to study something he is passionate about.

Greg decided he would give it a go. 

In March 2015, he took the Miller Analogies Test (MAT) and got admitted into the program. He planned to start in the summer, but the program did not have enough interest to begin the second cohort. Instead, he joined the first cohort and will make up missed coursework in January 2016.

The M.Ed in [Coaching Education and Athlete Development](http://www.xavier.edu/coaching) focuses on the following areas:

1. Coaching Pedagogy
2. Long-term Athlete Development
3. Character Development

Greg also earned his Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from Xavier in 2009.
