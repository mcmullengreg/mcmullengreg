Hey,

It is hard to try and find some internet in Ireland. But we have some access today and it&#8217;s expensive so this will be short.

* Castles? Amazing!
* Ireland? Amazing!
* Staying in a Castle? Friggin' sweet!
* By the end of the trip I will have seen the coast more here than in the US

That is all,
