One more week to go until the venture over to Ireland. I&#8217;m starting to get excited and nervous all at the same time. I&#8217;ve finally started my homework that is supposed to be turned in before I leave, but it&#8217;s hard to actually get the motivation to do it. One assignment is done, but now I need to find a way to get the book read and answer the questions.
