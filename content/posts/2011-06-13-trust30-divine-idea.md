> Imitation is Suicide. Insist on yourself; never imitate. – Ralph Waldo Emerson

Write down in which areas of your life you have to overcome these suicidal tendencies of imitation, and how you can transform them into a newborn you – one that doesn’t hide its uniqueness, but thrives on it. There is a &#8220;divine idea which each of us represents&#8221; – which is yours?

Every day I fight with the owner of my organization about trying something new within the realm of marketing. He&#8217;s dead set on looking at all of the other companies in the industry and saying &#8220;Well, they aren&#8217;t doing it, so why would I?&#8221; Being a true leader in an industry is what keeps you alive!

This quote is absolutely right. Imitation is suicide. You have to learn to differentiate yourself. People have said that imitation is a form of flattery, but is it really? No! It&#8217;s annoying. Anyone with a sibling knows how annoying a copy cat is. Making yourself different from your peers is what makes you &#8220;you.&#8221;

My goal every single day is to try and find who I am what I want to do and what/where I want to be in my life. That doesn&#8217;t come from being a copy cat; it comes from hard work and dedication&#8230;to you.

What are your thoughts on the subject? What is your &#8220;Divine Idea&#8221; that represents you?
