The 2013-2014 season at Rose-Hulman ended better than I ever could have imagined. After breaking more than 20 records in the [2012-2013 season](/posts/2013/05/season-recap-2012-13/ "2011-2012 Season Recap"), 
I never would have imagined breaking another 13. We sent two to the NCAA Division III National Championships.

Both swam well and [earned All-American status](https://rosehulman.prestosports.com/sports/swimdive/2013-14/releases/20140605ra7s23) by finishing in the top 8.

## Personal Challenges

This season was easier than last year.

From my point of view, I had a very successful season. I worked to understand the ideology behind the training structure, 
I trained starts and turns exclusively toward the end of the season and even had a stroke of genius, helping a freshman finish in the top 8 in a new event after observing his awesomeÂ back start.

Aside from that, I found a new coach to mentor. I&#8217;m extremely flattered that he sees me as his mentor, and I hope he continues to work in the swimming community.

## 2013-2014 Season Results

  * 2 All-Americans (first since 2003; first female in program, second in school history)
  * 2 National Swimmers of the Week
  * Men&#8217;s 2nd place at CCIW, program best (until 2014, when they won it all.)
  * 13 school records
  * 10 top-two finishers
  * 10 all-conference performances
