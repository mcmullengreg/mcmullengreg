People have asked me, why do you work so much? I didn&#8217;t really understand what they meant until this last year. Throughout the year, I work 3 different jobs which range, at times, from 5:30am until 8:00pm.

## Why do you work so much?

I don&#8217;t do it for the _pay_, I don&#8217;t do it for the recognition. I do it because I want to pay off my bills. I&#8217;ve worked the same base full-time job for nearly 3 years, and honestly it&#8217;s helped me pay off my debt better than I thought it would. I&#8217;ve had some excellent situations though that allowed me to pay off 2 student loans within a year of graduating.

**I&#8217;ve been blessed&#8230;** Thus far, I&#8217;ve only had to pay one years worth of rent which means everything else goes towards my car, student loans and (wait for it&#8230;&#8230;.) SAVINGS (401k and IRA)! ([@PeteThePlanner](http://twitter.com/petetheplanner) would be proud I&#8217;m sure)

I&#8217;ve never been much of a &#8220;student&#8221; &#8211; honestly I didn&#8217;t graduate from Xavier University with a great overall GPA, but there was one class that forced me to wake up and realize what I need to do. That class was Finance.

So Prof. Sisak, thank you. I never had a professor ingrain something in my head so deeply.

At 25 years old, I have one student loan to pay off along withÂ  $10k in a car loan left to pay. My goal is have no debt by the time Sarah finishes school and we buy our first home.
