Today&#8217;s task seems slightly more daunting than yesterday. Somehow I am supposed to describe my day in only one sentence. Shouldn&#8217;t be too hard&#8230;right? [Author Liz Danzico](http://dis.bobulate.com/about/).

**My Response:** Don&#8217;t let today get in the way of the rest of your life; you&#8217;ll have struggles but keep your friends and family close, they&#8217;re the best support you&#8217;ll ever need.
