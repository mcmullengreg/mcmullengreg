What would you say to the person you were five years ago? What will you say to the person you’ll be in five years?

---

Five years ago, I was in transition between the University of Evansville and Xavier University. The year was disappointing to me. First, I was over three hours away from the love of my life. Second, I failed to finish the first year of my collegiate swimming career. Finally, I completely messed up my back due to a weight lifting incident.

### What would I tell myself from five years ago?

Stay at UE! You went here because you had a chance to continue your swimming career. When we visited you fell in love with the campus and you will get a great education too. While the doctors said that your back would never be the same, you can adjust to it and will quickly.

Life will never be easy, but you don&#8217;t want to take the easy road. Continue on with your education until you feel like you are in a good spot to obtain the career of your dreams. Don&#8217;t forget to thank your friends and family for their support and love.

### What about five years from now?

Hmm. This one is tougher since I&#8217;m not entirely sure where I&#8217;ll be in five years. The first thing I would say is &#8220;thanks.&#8221; Thanks for making it this far and (hopefully) congratulations on whatever accomplishments I&#8217;ve made.

The last thing I would say is, &#8220;keep moving on, and don’t stop working towards your dreams. Always be there for your family and support their dreams as well. Don&#8217;t give up on what you believe in.&#8221;

So&#8230;now it&#8217;s your turn. How would you approach yourself five years ago? In five years?
