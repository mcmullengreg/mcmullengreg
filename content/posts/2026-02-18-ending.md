This website has been around for years. I've been inconsistent in blogging, writing and just about every other content piece.

That said, I'm making the conscience effort to say this website is just a place holder for me. And not something I'll actively maintain (at least for now).

Thanks to anyone that sees it. But it's just a small place where I live. Not something that will ever 'blow up' or become anything reliable. 

There may be occasional updates (like me adding my [coaching philosophy](/philosophy/)) and this post. But that's about it for now.

So long blog. So long writing. Everything here is just for a historical reference now.
