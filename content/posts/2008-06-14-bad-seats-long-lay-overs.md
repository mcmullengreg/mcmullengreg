Hello everybody! Just so everyone knows I made it to Ireland safe and sound. The flight was long, and very boring and also very uncomfortable. However, I did realize that Shannon International has FREE WI-FI, hence the reason I am writing right now. So after I get out of the airport I should be able to do some visiting of the area and being able to enjoy my self in the land of my forefathers.

Hopefully everyone is doing well and I will try to keep this up-t0-date with Photos, video, and updated content.

Have a safe summer!!!!
