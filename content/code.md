## My Code

I build systems that work — not just look good.  
I enjoy designing clean, maintainable solutions to messy real-world problems, and I prioritize clarity, collaboration, and long-term sustainability in everything I build.

Most of the work below reflects projects where I led implementation or architectural decisions.

## Technologies I Use Often

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: PHP
- Databases: MySQL, MariaDB
- Tools: Git, Lando, NPM, Homebrew
