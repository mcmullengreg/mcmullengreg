I coach swimming because I love this sport.

I grew up in it. I learned from it. It shaped me. And at some point, I realized the best way to honor that gift was to give it back.

Swimming is not just laps and times. It is structure. It is discipline. It is chaos managed one stroke at a time.

At its best, swimming teaches you how to handle life.

I do not coach to create champions first.
I coach to create confident, resilient, accountable people who happen to swim fast.

Winning is a byproduct. Growth is the goal.

## What I Believe

I believe:
  •	Effort means giving your best in that moment — not performing for applause.
  •	Failure is feedback, not identity.
  •	Quitting is the only true loss.
  •	Talent without character will eventually stall.
  •	Character without talent will always grow.

I am not a loud, rah-rah coach. I believe in presence, clarity, and consistency.

My athletes know where they stand. They also know I care about them as people before I care about them as swimmers.

## The Environment I Try to Create

I want my athletes to feel safe enough to:
  •	Try a new strategy and fail.
  •	Take a risk in a race.
  •	Admit when something is hard.
  •	Be honest about their effort.

But I also want them to feel challenged enough to:
  •	Hold themselves accountable.
  •	Show up for their teammates.
  •	Push when it gets uncomfortable.
  •	Stay when it gets hard.

After a bad swim, we take five minutes.

Be frustrated. Be disappointed.

Then we rebound.

That is emotional strength.

I am not here to be their friend.
I am here to be their coach — someone they can trust, respect, and grow under.

## Faith and Leadership

My faith shapes how I coach.

I try to lead with grace, accountability, and humility — knowing I fall short myself.

I believe in second chances. I believe in growth. I believe people are more than their worst moment.

That doesn’t mean standards disappear. It means discipline and compassion can coexist.

I aim to treat my athletes the way I hope to be treated: with clarity, honesty, and care.

## My Why

I coach because I want young athletes to love this sport the way I do.

Not just as competitors.

But as lifelong swimmers.

I want them to leave knowing:
  •	How to train themselves.
  •	How to manage their time.
  •	How to speak confidently to adults.
  •	How to compete with integrity.
  •	How to balance life when it feels chaotic.

If, ten years from now, they say,

“He cared about me as a person.”

Then I have done my job.

And if they come back one day — to swim, to coach, or to teach their own children — then the work mattered.
