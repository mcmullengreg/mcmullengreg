**Husband. Father. Coach. Web Developer.**

Currently
  - Lead Web Developer, University of Missouri–Kansas City
  -	Head Coach, Batesville Swimming
  -	Board Member, Citizens Aquatic Center

Those roles shape how I think, work, and lead.

At the center of all of it is purpose.

I’m driven by seeing potential &ndash; in people, in systems, and in organizations &ndash; and helping develop it with structure and intention.

## The Through Line

Whether I’m building digital systems or coaching athletes, the work is similar:
  -	Identify what’s possible
  -	Clarify what’s misaligned
  -	Build structure that supports growth
  -	Develop people toward sustainable success

I discovered web development early through a school camp where my mom worked. Traditional programming felt overwhelming, but web development clicked. It was structured, creative, and practical. Over time, that interest became a career built on refining systems, improving processes, and bridging technical and non-technical teams.

Coaching came later &ndash; initially as something to do while my wife was in medical school. What began casually became deeply meaningful. It sharpened my leadership, strengthened my communication, and reinforced something I believe strongly:

Strong systems and strong people are built the same way &ndash; intentionally.

## Professional Focus

In my professional role, I focus on:
  -	Building scalable and maintainable web systems
  -	Improving workflows and governance
  -	Thinking strategically about user experience
  -	Translating complex technical concepts into clear communication

I value:
  -	Clean architecture over quick fixes
  -	Long-term sustainability over short-term patches
  -	Process clarity over unnecessary complexity

I am comfortable leading projects, supporting teams, and working at the intersection of strategy and execution.

While I’m content in my current role, I am always open to thoughtful conversations about building strong digital ecosystems and effective teams.

## Coaching & Leadership

Coaching swimming has shaped my leadership as much as any professional role.

I believe in developing people first and competitors second.

I believe:
  -	Winning is a byproduct.
  -	Growth is the goal.
  -	Quitting is the only true loss.
  -	Character outlasts talent.

Coaching has taught me how to manage expectations &ndash; both my own and others’. It has taught me how to balance empathy with accountability and how to maintain standards without losing humanity.

My faith influences how I lead. I strive to lead with humility, clarity, and grace &ndash; knowing I fall short at times. I believe discipline and compassion can coexist.

Above all, I care deeply about the people entrusted to me.

## Family & Foundation

My family is my foundation.

I don’t know who I’d be without my wife and children. They ground my decisions and remind me what matters most.

Coaching and development are important to me &ndash; but my primary calling is at home.

---

## What Drives Me
  -	Purpose over noise
  -	Growth over ego
  -	Consistency over intensity
  -	Character over image

If you’re here as a colleague, coach, or potential collaborator, I hope this gives you a clear picture of how I approach my work and leadership.

I care about building things that last &ndash; whether that’s code, culture, or character.
